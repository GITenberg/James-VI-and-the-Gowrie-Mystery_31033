<h2><!-- page vii--><a name="pagevii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. vii</span>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>An old Scottish lady, four generations ago, used to say,
&lsquo;It is a great comfort to think that, at the Day of
Judgment, we shall know the whole truth about the Gowrie
Conspiracy at last.&rsquo;&nbsp; Since the author, as a child,
read &lsquo;The Tales of a Grandfather,&rsquo; and shared King
Jamie&rsquo;s disappointment when there was no pot of gold, but
an armed man, in the turret, he had supposed that we do know all
about the Gowrie Conspiracy, that it was a plot to capture the
King, carry him to Fastcastle, and &lsquo;see how the country
would take it,&rsquo; as in the case of the Gunpowder Plot.&nbsp;
But just as Father Gerard has tried to show that the Gunpowder
affair may have been Cecil&rsquo;s plot, so modern historians
doubt whether the Gowrie mystery was not a conspiracy by King
James himself.&nbsp; Mr. Hume Brown appears rather to lean to
this opinion, in the second volume of his &lsquo;History of
Scotland,&rsquo; and Dr. Masson, in his valuable edition of the
&lsquo;Register of the Privy Council,&rsquo; is also
dubious.&nbsp; Mr. Louis Barb&eacute;, in his &lsquo;Tragedy of
Gowrie House,&rsquo; holds a brief against the King.&nbsp; Thus I
have been tempted to study this <!-- page viii--><a
name="pageviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
viii</span>&lsquo;auld misterie&rsquo; afresh, and have convinced
myself that such historians as Sir Walter Scott, Mr. Frazer
Tytler, and Mr. Hill Burton were not wrong; the plot was not the
King&rsquo;s conspiracy, but the desperate venture of two very
young men.&nbsp; The precise object remains obscure in detail,
but the purpose was probably to see how a deeply discontented
Kirk and country &lsquo;would take it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In working at this fascinatingly mysterious puzzle, I have
made use of manuscript materials hitherto uncited.&nbsp; The most
curious of these, the examinations and documents of the
&lsquo;country writer,&rsquo; Sprot, had been briefly summarised
in Sir William Fraser&rsquo;s &lsquo;Memorials of the Earls of
Haddington.&rsquo;&nbsp; My attention was drawn to this source by
the Rev. John Anderson, of the General Register House, who aided
Sir William Fraser in the compilation of his book.&nbsp; The Earl
of Haddington generously permitted me to have copies made of the
documents, which Lady Cecily Baillie-Hamilton was kind enough to
search for and rediscover in an enormous mass of documents
bequeathed by the learned first Earl.</p>
<p>On reading the Calendars of the Hatfield MSS. I had observed
that several letters by the possible conspirator, Logan of
Restalrig, were in the possession of the Marquis of Salisbury,
who was good enough to permit photographs of some specimens to be
taken.&nbsp; These were compared, by Mr. Anderson, with the
alleged plot-letters of Logan at Edinburgh; while photographs of
the plot-letters were compared <!-- page ix--><a
name="pageix"></a><span class="pagenum">p. ix</span>with
Logan&rsquo;s authentic letters at Hatfield, by Mr. Gunton, to
whose acuteness and energy I owe the greatest gratitude.&nbsp;
The results of the comparison settle the riddle of three
centuries.</p>
<p>The other hitherto unused manuscripts are in no more recondite
place than the Record Office in London, and I do not know how
they managed to escape the notice of previous writers on the
subject.&nbsp; To Dr. Masson&rsquo;s &lsquo;Register of the Privy
Council&rsquo; I am indebted for the sequel of the curious
adventure of Mr. Robert Oliphant, whose part in the mystery,
hitherto overlooked, is decisive, if we accept the
evidence&mdash;a point on which the reader must form his own
opinion.&nbsp; For copies made at the Record Office I have to
thank the care and accuracy of Miss E. M. Thompson.</p>
<p>To Mr. Anderson&rsquo;s learning and zest in this
&lsquo;longest and sorest chase&rsquo; (as King James called his
hunt on the morning of the fatal August 5) I am under the deepest
obligations.&nbsp; The allurements of a romantic conclusion have
never tempted him to leave the strait path of historical
impartiality.</p>
<p>I have also to thank Mr. Henry Paton for his careful copies of
the Haddington MSS., extracts from the Treasurer&rsquo;s
accounts, and other researches.</p>
<p>For permission to reproduce the picture of Fastcastle by the
Rev. Mr. Thomson of Duddingston, I have to thank the kindness of
Mrs. Blackwood-Porter.&nbsp; The painting, probably of about
1820, when compared <!-- page x--><a name="pagex"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. x</span>with the photograph of to-day, shows
the destruction wrought by wind and weather in the old
fortalice.</p>
<p>My obligations to Sir James Balfour Paul (Lyon King of Arms)
for information on points of Heraldry ought to be gratefully
acknowledged.</p>
<p>Since this book was written, the author has had an opportunity
to read an Apology for the Ruthvens by the late Andrew
Bisset.&nbsp; This treatise is apt to escape observation: it is
entitled &lsquo;Sir Walter Scott,&rsquo; and occupies pp.
172&ndash;303 in &lsquo;Essays on Historical Truth,&rsquo; long
out of print. <a name="citation0a"></a><a href="#footnote0a"
class="citation">[0a]</a>&nbsp; On many points Mr. Bisset agreed
with Mr. Barb&eacute; in his &lsquo;Tragedy of Gowrie
House,&rsquo; and my replies to Mr. Barb&eacute; serve for his
predecessor.&nbsp; But Mr. Bisset found no evidence that the King
had formed a plot against Gowrie.&nbsp; By a modification of the
contemporary conjecture of Sir William Bowes he suggested that a
brawl between the King and the Master of Ruthven occurred in the
turret, occasioned by an atrocious insult offered to the Master
by the King.&nbsp; This hypothesis, for various reasons, does not
deserve discussion.&nbsp; Mr. Bisset appeared to attribute the
Sprot papers to the combined authorship of the King and Sir
Thomas Hamilton: which our new materials disprove.&nbsp; A critic
who, like Mr. Bisset, accused the King of poisoning Prince Henry,
and many other persons, was not an unprejudiced historian.</p>

<h2><!-- page 1--><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1</span>I.&nbsp; THE MYSTERY AND THE EVIDENCE</h2>
<p>There are enigmas in the annals of most peoples; riddles put
by the Sphinx of the Past to the curious of the new
generations.&nbsp; These questions do not greatly concern the
scientific historian, who is busy with constitution-making,
statistics, progress, degeneration, in short with human
evolution.&nbsp; These high matters, these streams of tendency,
form the staple of history, but the problems of personal
character and action still interest some inquiring minds.&nbsp;
Among these enigmas nearly the most obscure, &lsquo;The Gowrie
Conspiracy,&rsquo; is our topic.</p>
<p>This affair is one of the haunting mysteries of the past, one
of the problems that nobody has solved.&nbsp; The events occurred
in 1600, but the interest which they excited was so keen that
belief in the guilt or innocence of the two noble brothers who
perished in an August afternoon, was a party shibboleth in the
Wars of the Saints against the Malignants, the strife <!-- page
2--><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>of
Cavaliers and Roundheads.&nbsp; The problem has ever since
attracted the curious, as do the enigma of Perkin Warbeck, the
true character of Richard III, the real face behind &lsquo;The
Iron Mask,&rsquo; the identity of the False Pucelle, and the
innocence or guilt of Mary Stuart.</p>
<p>In certain respects the Gowrie mystery is necessarily less
attractive than that of &lsquo;the fairest and most pitiless
Queen on earth.&rsquo;&nbsp; There is no woman in the
story.&nbsp; The world, of course, when the Ruthvens died, at
once acted on the maxim, <i>cherchez la femme</i>.&nbsp; The
woman in the case, men said, was the beautiful Queen, Anne of
Denmark, wife of James VI.&nbsp; That fair and frivolous dame,
&lsquo;very very woman,&rsquo; certainly did her best, by her
behaviour, to encourage the belief that she was the cause of
these sorrows.&nbsp; Even so, when the Bonny Earl Moray&mdash;the
tallest and most beautiful man in Scotland&mdash;died like a lion
dragged down by wolves, the people sang:</p>
<blockquote><p>He was a brave gallant,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And he rode at the ring,<br />
And the Bonny Earl Moray,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He might have been the King.</p>
<p>He was a brave gallant,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And he rode at the glove,<br />
And the Bonny Earl Moray<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He was the Queen&rsquo;s love.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On one side was a beautiful Queen mated with James VI, a
pedant and a clown.&nbsp; On the other side were, first the Bonny
Earl, then the Earl of <!-- page 3--><a name="page3"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 3</span>Gowrie, both young, brave, handsome,
both suddenly slain by the King&rsquo;s friends: none knew
why.&nbsp; The opinion of the godly, of the Kirk, of the people,
and even of politicians, leaped to the erroneous conclusion that
the young men perished, like K&ouml;nigsmarck, because they were
beautiful and beloved, and because the Queen was fair and kind,
and the King was ugly, treacherous, and jealous.&nbsp; The rumour
also ran, at least in tradition, that Gowrie &lsquo;might have
been the King,&rsquo; an idea examined in Appendix A.&nbsp; Here
then was an explanation of the slaying of the Ruthvens on the
lines dear to romance.&nbsp; The humorous King Jamie (who, if he
was not always sensible, at least treated his flighty wife with
abundance of sense) had to play the part of King Mark of Cornwall
to Gowrie&rsquo;s Sir Tristram.&nbsp; For this theory, we shall
show, no evidence exists, and, in &lsquo;looking for the
woman,&rsquo; fancy found two men.&nbsp; The Queen was
alternately said to love Gowrie, and to love his brother, the
Master of Ruthven, a lad of nineteen&mdash;if she did not love
both at once.&nbsp; It is curious that the affair did not give
rise to ballads; if it did, none has reached us.</p>
<p>In truth there was no woman in the case, and this of course
makes the mystery much less exciting than that of Mary Stuart,
for whom so many swords and pens have been drawn.&nbsp; The
interest of character and of love is deficient.&nbsp; Of
Gowrie&rsquo;s character, and even of his religion, apart from
his learning and fascination, we really know almost <!-- page
4--><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>nothing.&nbsp; Did he cherish that strongest and most
sacred of passions, revenge; had he brooded over it in Italy,
where revenge was subtler and craftier than in Scotland?&nbsp;
Did this passion blend with the vein of fanaticism in his
nature?&nbsp; Had he been biding his time, and dreaming, over
sea, boyish dreams of vengeance and ambition?&nbsp; All this
appears not improbable, and would, if true, explain all; but
evidence is defective.&nbsp; Had Gowrie really cherished the
legacy of revenge for a father slain, and a mother insulted; had
he studied the subtleties of Italian crime, pondered over an
Italian plot till it seemed feasible, and communicated his vision
to the boy brother whom he found at home&mdash;the mystery would
be transparent.</p>

</a></p>
<p>As to King James, we know him well.&nbsp; The babe
&lsquo;wronged in his mother&rsquo;s womb;&rsquo; threatened by
conspirators before his birth; terrified by a harsh tutor as a
child; bullied; preached at; captured; insulted; ruled now by
debauched favourites, now by godly ruffians; James naturally grew
up a dissembler, and betrayed his father&rsquo;s murderer with a
kiss.&nbsp; He was frightened into deceit: he could be cruel; he
became, as far as he might, a tyrant.&nbsp; But, though not the
abject coward of tradition, James (as he himself observed) was
never the man to risk his life in a doubtful brawl, on the chance
that his enemies might perish while he escaped.&nbsp; For him a
treachery of that kind, an affair of sword and dagger fights on
staircases and in turrets and chambers, in the midst of a town of
doubtful loyalty, had <!-- page 5--><a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>certainly no attractions.&nbsp;
Moreover, he had a sense of humour.&nbsp; This has been the
opinion of our best historians, Scott, Mr. Tytler, and Mr. Hill
Burton; but enthusiastic writers have always espoused the cause
of the victims, the Ruthvens, so young, brave, handsome; so
untimely slain, as it were on their own hearthstone.&nbsp; Other
authors, such as Dr. Masson in our own day, and Mr. S. R.
Gardiner, have abstained from a verdict, or have attempted the
<i>via media</i>; have leaned to the idea that the Ruthvens died
in an accidental brawl, caused by a nervous and motiveless fit of
terror on the part of the King.&nbsp; Thus the question is
unsettled, the problem is unsolved.&nbsp; Why did the jolly hunt
at Falkland, in the bright August morning, end in the sanguinary
scuffle in the town house at Perth; the deaths of the Ruthvens;
the tumult in the town; the King&rsquo;s homeward ride through
the dark and dripping twilight; the laying of the dead brothers
side by side, while the old family servant weeps above their
bodies; and the wailing of the Queen and her ladies in Falkland
Palace, when the torches guide the cavalcade into the palace
court, and the strange tale of slaughter is variously told,
&lsquo;the reports so fighting together that no man could have
any certainty&rsquo;?&nbsp; Where lay the actual truth?</p>
<p>This problem, with which the following pages are concerned, is
much darker and more complex than that of the guilty
&lsquo;Casket Letters&rsquo; attributed to Mary, Queen of
Scots.&nbsp; The Queen did write these, in the <!-- page 6--><a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>madness of a
criminal passion; or she wrote parts of them, the rest being
garbled or forged.&nbsp; In either case, her motives, and the
motives of the possible forgers, are distinct, and are
human.&nbsp; The Queen was in love with one man, and hated
another to the death; or her enemies desired to prove that these
were her moods.&nbsp; Absolute certainty escapes us, but, either
way, motives and purposes are intelligible.</p>
<p>Not so with the Gowrie mystery.&nbsp; The King, Mary&rsquo;s
son, after hunting for four hours, rides to visit Lord Gowrie, a
neighbour.&nbsp; After luncheon, that nobleman and his brother
are slain, in their own house, by the King&rsquo;s
attendants.&nbsp; The King gives his version of the events
instantly; he never varies from it in any essential point, but
the story is almost incredible.&nbsp; On the other hand, the
slain men cannot speak, and only one of them, if both were
innocent, could have told what occurred.&nbsp; But one of their
apologists, at the time, produced a version of the events which
is, beyond all doubt, boldly mendacious.&nbsp; It was easy to
criticise and ridicule the King&rsquo;s version; but the opposite
version, hitherto unknown to historians, destroys itself by its
conspicuous falsehoods.&nbsp; In the nature of the case, as will
appear, no story accounting for such wild events could be easily
credible, so extraordinary, motiveless, and inexplicable do the
circumstances appear.&nbsp; If we try the theory that the King
wove a plot, we are met by the fact that his plot could not have
succeeded without the voluntary and vehement collaboration of one
of his victims, a thing that <!-- page 7--><a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>no man could
have reckoned on.&nbsp; If we adopt the idea that the victims had
laid a trap for the King, we have only a vague surmise as to its
aim, purpose, and method.&nbsp; The later light which seemed to
fall on the affair, as we shall see, only darkens what was
already obscure.&nbsp; The inconceivable iniquity of the
Government, at a later date, reflects such discredit on all
concerned on their side, that we might naturally, though
illogically, be inclined to believe that, from the first, the
King was the conspirator.&nbsp; But <i>that</i>, we shall find,
was almost, or quite, a physical impossibility.</p>
<p>Despite these embroilments, I am, in this case, able to reach
a conclusion satisfactory to myself, a thing which, in the affair
of the Casket Letters and Queen Mary, I was unable to do. <a
name="citation7"></a><a href="#footnote7"
class="citation">[7]</a>&nbsp; There is no doubt, in my own mind,
that the Earl of Gowrie and his brother laid a trap for King
James, and fell into the pit which they had digged.</p>
<p>To what precise end they had plotted to seize the King&rsquo;s
person, what they meant to do with him when they had got him,
must remain matter of conjecture.&nbsp; But that they intended to
seize him, I have no doubt at all.</p>
<p>These pages, on so old and vexed a problem, would not have
been written, had I not been fortunate enough to obtain many
unpublished manuscript materials.&nbsp; Some of these at least
clear up the secondary enigma of the sequel of the problem of
<!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>1600.&nbsp; Different readers will probably draw
different conclusions from some of the other documents, but
perhaps nobody will doubt that they throw strange new lights on
Scottish manners and morals.</p>
<p>The scheme adopted here is somewhat like that of Mr.
Browning&rsquo;s poem, &lsquo;The Ring and the Book.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The personages tell their own stories of the same set of events,
in which they were more or less intimately concerned.&nbsp; This
inevitably entails some repetition, but I am unable to find any
plan less open to objection.</p>
<p>It must, of course, be kept in mind that all the evidence is
of a suspicious nature.&nbsp; The King, if he were the
conspirator, or even if innocent, had to clear himself; and,
frankly, his Majesty&rsquo;s word was not to be relied
upon.&nbsp; However, he alone was cross-examined, by an acute and
hostile catechist, and that upon oath, though not in a court of
justice.&nbsp; The evidence of his retinue, and of some other
persons present, was also taken on oath, three months after the
events, before a Parliamentary Committee, &lsquo;The Lords of the
Articles.&rsquo;&nbsp; We shall see that, nine years later, a
similar Committee was deceived shamelessly by the King&rsquo;s
Government, he himself being absent in England.&nbsp; But the
nature of the evidence, in the second case, was entirely
different: it did not rest on the sworn testimony of a number of
nobles, gentlemen, and citizens, but on a question of
handwriting, <i>comparatio literarum</i>, as in the case of the
Casket Letters.&nbsp; That the witnesses in 1600 did not <!--
page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>perjure themselves, in the trial which followed on the
slaughter of the Ruthvens, is what I have to argue.&nbsp; Next,
we have the evidence, taken under torture, of three of the slain
Earl&rsquo;s retainers, three weeks after the events.&nbsp; No
such testimony is now reckoned of value, but it will be shown
that the statements made by the tortured men only compromise the
Earl and his brother incidentally, and in a manner probably not
perceived by the deponents themselves.&nbsp; They denied all
knowledge of a plot, disclaimed belief in a plot by the Earl, and
let out what was suspicious in a casual way, without observing
the import of their own remarks.</p>
<p>Finally, we have the evidence of the only living man, except
the King, who was present at the central point of the
occurrences.&nbsp; That this man was a most false and evasive
character, that he was doubtless amenable to bribes, that he was
richly rewarded, I freely admit.&nbsp; But I think it can be made
probable, by evidence hitherto overlooked, that he really was
present on the crucial occasion, and that, with all allowances
for his character and position, his testimony fits into the
facts, while, if it be discarded, no hypothesis can account for
<i>him</i>, and his part in the adventure.&nbsp; In short, the
King&rsquo;s tale, almost incredible as it appears, contains the
only explanation which is not demonstrably impossible.&nbsp; To
this conclusion, let me repeat, I am drawn by no sentiment for
that unsentimental Prince, &lsquo;gentle King Jamie.&rsquo;&nbsp;
He was not the man to tell the truth, &lsquo;if he could <!--
page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>think of anything better.&rsquo;&nbsp; But, where other
corroboration is impossible, by the nature of the circumstances,
facts corroborate the King&rsquo;s narrative.&nbsp; His version
&lsquo;colligates&rsquo; them; though extravagant they become not
incoherent.&nbsp; No other hypothesis produces coherency: each
guess breaks down on demonstrated facts.</p>
<h2><!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>II.&nbsp; THE SLAUGHTER OF THE RUTHVENS</h2>
<p>In the month of August 1600 his Majesty the King of Scotland,
James, sixth of that name, stood in more than common need of the
recreation of the chase.&nbsp; Things had been going contrary to
his pleasure in all directions.&nbsp; &lsquo;His dearest
sister,&rsquo; Queen Elizabeth (as he pathetically said), seemed
likely &lsquo;to continue as long as Sun or Moon,&rsquo; and was
in the worst of humours.&nbsp; Her minister, Cecil, was
apparently more ill disposed towards the Scottish King than
usual, while the minister&rsquo;s rival, the Earl of Essex, had
been suggesting to James plans for a military demonstration on
the Border.&nbsp; Money was even more than normally scarce; the
Highlands were more than common unruly; stories of new
conspiracies against the King&rsquo;s liberty were flying about;
and, above all, a Convention of the Estates had just refused, in
June, to make a large grant of money to his Majesty.&nbsp; It was
also irritating that an old and trusted servant, Colonel Stewart,
wished to quit the country, and take English service against the
Irish rebels.&nbsp; This gentleman, sixteen years before, had
been instrumental in the arrest and execution of the Earl of
Gowrie; the new young Earl, <!-- page 12--><a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>son of the
late peer, had just returned from the Continent to Scotland, and
Colonel Stewart was afraid that Gowrie might wish to avenge his
father.&nbsp; Therefore he desired to take service in
Ireland.</p>
<p>With all these frets, the King needed the refreshment of
hunting the buck in his park of Falkland.&nbsp; He ordered his
own hunting costume; it was delivered early in August, and (which
is singular) was paid for instantly.&nbsp; Green English cloth
was the basis of his apparel, and five ounces of silver decorated
his second-best &lsquo;socks.&rsquo;&nbsp; His boots had velvet
tops, embroidered; his best &lsquo;socks&rsquo; were adorned with
heavy gold embroidery; he even bought a new horse.&nbsp; His
gentlemen, John Ramsay, John Murray, George Murray, and John
Auchmuty, were attired, at the Royal expense, in coats of green
cloth, like the King. <a name="citation12a"></a><a
href="#footnote12a" class="citation">[12a]</a></p>
<p>Thus equipped, the Royal party rose early on the morning of
Tuesday, August 5, left the pleasant house of Falkland, with its
strong round towers that had lately protected James from an
attack by his cousin, wild Frank Stewart, the Earl of Bothwell;
and rode to the stables in the park; &lsquo;the weather,&rsquo;
says his Majesty, &lsquo;being wonderful pleasant and
seasonable.&rsquo; <a name="citation12b"></a><a
href="#footnote12b" class="citation">[12b]</a>&nbsp; &lsquo;All
the jolly hunt was there;&rsquo; &lsquo;Tell True&rsquo; and the
other hounds were yelping at the limits of their leashes; the
Duke of Lennox and the Earl of Mar, <!-- page 13--><a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>friends of
James from his youth, and honourable men, were the chief nobles
in the crowd; wherein were two or three of the loyal family of
Erskine, cousins of Mar, and a Dr. Herries, remarkable for a club
foot.</p>
<p>At the stables, hacks were discarded, hunters were led out,
men were mounting, the King had his foot in the stirrup, when a
young gentleman, the Master of Ruthven, rode swiftly up from the
town of Falkland.&nbsp; He had trotted over, very early, from the
town house, at Perth (some twelve or fourteen miles away), of his
brother, the Earl of Gowrie.&nbsp; He was but nineteen years of
age, tall, handsome, and brother of the Queen&rsquo;s favourite
maid of honour, Mrs. Beatrix Ruthven.&nbsp; That he was himself
one of the Gentlemen of the Household has often been said, but we
find no trace of money spent for him in the Royal accounts: in
fact he had asked for the place, but had not yet obtained it. <a
name="citation13"></a><a href="#footnote13"
class="citation">[13]</a>&nbsp; However, if we may believe the
Royal word (which is a matter of choice), James &lsquo;loved the
young Master like a brother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Master approached the King, and entered into conversation
with him.&nbsp; James&rsquo;s account of what he had to say must
be given later.&nbsp; For the present we may be content with the
depositions on oath, which were made later, at a trial in
November, by the attendants of the King and other
witnesses.&nbsp; Among these was the Duke of Lennox, who swore to
the following effect.&nbsp; They hunted their buck, and killed
<!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>him.&nbsp; The King, in place of trotting back to lunch
at the House of Falkland (to which the progress of the chase had
led the sportsmen round in a circle), bade the Duke accompany him
to Perth, some twelve miles away, &lsquo;to speak with the Earl
of Gowrie.&rsquo;&nbsp; His Majesty then rode on.&nbsp; Lennox
despatched his groom for his sword, and for a fresh horse
(another was sent after the King); he then mounted and
followed.&nbsp; When he rejoined James, the King said &lsquo;You
cannot guess what errand I am riding for; I am going to get a
treasure in Perth.&nbsp; The Master of Ruthven&rsquo; (&lsquo;Mr.
Alexander Ruthven&rsquo;) &lsquo;has informed me that he has
found a man with a pitcher full of gold coins of great
sorts.&rsquo;&nbsp; James also asked Lennox what he deemed of the
Master, whose manner he reckoned very strange.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Nothing but an honest, discreet gentleman,&rsquo; said the
Duke.&nbsp; The King next gave details about the treasure, and
Lennox said he thought the tale &lsquo;unlikely,&rsquo; as it
was, more or less.&nbsp; James then bade Lennox say nothing on
the matter to Ruthven, who wanted it to be a secret.&nbsp; At
about a mile from Perth, the Master galloped forward, to warn his
brother, the Earl, who met the Royal party, on foot, with some
companions, near the town. <a name="citation14"></a><a
href="#footnote14" class="citation">[14]</a>&nbsp; This was about
one o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The Royal party, of thirteen nobles and gentlemen, then
entered the Earl&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; It faced the street, as the
House of Falkland also does, and, at the back, had gardens
running down to the Tay.&nbsp; <!-- page 15--><a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>It is
necessary to understand the situation and topography of Gowrie
House.&nbsp; Passing down South Street, or &lsquo;Shoe
Gait,&rsquo; the chief street in Perth, then a pretty little
town, you found it crossed at right angles by a street called, on
the left, Water Gate, on the right, Spey Gate.&nbsp; Immediately
fronting you, as you came to the end of South Street, was the
gateway of Gowrie House, the garden wall continuing towards your
right.&nbsp; On your left were the houses in Water Gate, occupied
by rich citizens and lairds.&nbsp; Many will understand the
position if they fancy themselves walking down one of the streets
which run from the High Street, at Oxford, towards the
river.&nbsp; You then find Merton College facing you, the street
being <!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>continued to the left in such old
houses as Beam Hall.&nbsp; The gate of Gowrie House fronted you,
as does the gate-tower of Merton, and led into a quadrangle, the
front court, called The Close.&nbsp; Behind Gowrie House was the
garden, and behind that ran the river Tay, as the Isis flows
behind Merton and Corpus.&nbsp; Entering the quadrangle of Gowrie
House you found, on your right and facing you, a pile of
buildings like an inverted L (&#9488;).&nbsp; The basement was
occupied by domestic offices: at the angle of the &#9488; was the
main entrance.&nbsp; On your right, and much nearer to you than
the main entrance, a door opened on a narrow spiral staircase, so
dark that it was called the Black Turnpike.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p17b.jpg">
<img alt=
"Interior of Gowrie House"
title=
"Interior of Gowrie House"
src="images/p17s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>As to the interior, entering the main doorway you found
yourself in the hall.&nbsp; A door led thence into a smaller
dining-room on the left.&nbsp; The hall itself had a door and
external stair giving on the garden behind.&nbsp; The chief
staircase, which you entered from the hall, led to the Great
Gallery, built and decorated by the late Earl.&nbsp; This
extended above the dining-room and the hall, and, to the right,
was separated by a partition and a door from the large upstairs
room on the same flat called &lsquo;The Gallery
Chamber.&rsquo;&nbsp; At the extremity of this chamber, on the
left hand as you advanced, was a door leading into a
&lsquo;round,&rsquo; or turret, or little circular-shaped
&lsquo;study,&rsquo; of which one window seems to have looked to
the gateway, the other to the street.&nbsp; People below in the
street could see a man looking out of the turret window.&nbsp; A
door in the gallery chamber gave on the narrow <!-- page 18--><a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>staircase
called &lsquo;The Black Turnpike,&rsquo; by which the upper floor
might be reached by any one from the quadrangle, without entering
the main door, and going up the broad chief staircase.&nbsp;
Thus, to quote a poet who wrote while Gowrie House was extant (in
1638):</p>
<blockquote><p>The Palace kythes, may nam&rsquo;d be
Perth&rsquo;s White Hall<br />
With orchards like these of Hesperides.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The palace was destroyed, to furnish a site for a gaol and
county buildings, in 1807, but the most interesting parts had
long been in ruins. <a name="citation18"></a><a
href="#footnote18" class="citation">[18]</a></p>
<p>In 1774, an antiquary, Mr. Cant, writes that the palace, after
the Forty Five, was converted into artillery barracks.&nbsp;
&lsquo;We see nothing but the remains of its former
grandeur.&rsquo;&nbsp; The coats of arms of &lsquo;the nobility
and gentlemen of fortune,&rsquo; who dwelt in Spey Gate and Water
Gate, were, in 1774, still visible on the walls of their
houses.&nbsp; A fragment of the old palace is said to exist
to-day in the Gowrie Inn.&nbsp; Into this palace the King was led
by Gowrie: he was taken to the dining chamber on the left of the
great hall; in the hall itself Lennox, Mar, and the rest of the
retinue waited and wearied, for apparently no dinner had been
provided, and even a drink for his thirsty Majesty was long in
coming.&nbsp; Gowrie and the Master kept going in and out,
servants were <!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>whispered to, and Sir Thomas Erskine
sent a townsman to buy him a pair of green silk stockings in
Perth. <a name="citation19"></a><a href="#footnote19"
class="citation">[19]</a>&nbsp; He wanted to dine
comfortably.</p>
<p>Leaving the King&rsquo;s retinue in the hall, and the King in
the dining chamber off the hall, we may note what, up to this
point, the nobles and gentlemen of the suite had to say, at the
trial in November, about the adventures of that August
morning.&nbsp; Mar had not seen the Master at Falkland; after the
kill Mar did not succeed in rejoining James till they were within
two or three miles of Perth.</p>
<p>Drummond of Inchaffray had nodded to the Master, at Falkland,
before the Master met the King at the stables.&nbsp; He later saw
the Master in conference for about a quarter of an hour with
James, outside the stables.&nbsp; The Master then left the King:
Inchaffray invited him to breakfast, but he declined, &lsquo;as
his Majesty had ordered him to wait upon him.&rsquo;&nbsp;
(According to other evidence he had already breakfasted at
Falkland.)&nbsp; Inchaffray then breakfasted in Falkland town,
and next rode along the highway towards his own house.&nbsp; On
the road he overtook Lennox, Lindores, Urchill, Hamilton of
Grange, Finlay Taylor, the King, and the Master, riding
Perthwards.&nbsp; He joined them, and went with them into Gowrie
House.</p>
<p>Nobody else, among the witnesses, did anything but agree with
Lennox&rsquo;s account up to this point.&nbsp; But four menials
of James, for example, a cellarer <!-- page 20--><a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>and a porter,
were at Gowrie House, in addition to the nobles and gentlemen who
gave this evidence.</p>
<p>To return to Lennox&rsquo;s tale: dinner was not ready for his
hungry Majesty, as we have said, till an hour after his arrival;
was not ready, indeed, till about two o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; He had
obviously not been expected, or Gowrie did not wish it to be
known that he was expected, and himself had dined before the
King&rsquo;s arrival, between twelve and one o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp;
A shoulder of mutton, a fowl, and a solitary grouse were all that
the Earl&rsquo;s caterer could procure, except cold meat:
obviously a poor repast to set before a king.&nbsp; It is said
that the Earl had meant to leave Perth in the afternoon.&nbsp;
When James reached the stage of dessert, Gowrie, who had waited
on him, entered the hall, and invited the suite to dine.&nbsp;
When they had nearly finished, Gowrie returned to them in the
hall, and sent round a grace-cup, in which all pledged the
King.&nbsp; Lennox then rose, to rejoin the King (who now passed,
with the Master, across and out of the hall), but Gowrie said
&lsquo;His Majesty was gone upstairs quietly some quiet
errand.&rsquo;&nbsp; Gowrie then called for the key of the
garden, on the banks of the Tay, and he, Lindores, the lame Dr.
Herries, and others went into the garden, where, one of them
tells us, they ate cherries.&nbsp; While they were thus engaged,
Gowrie&rsquo;s equerry, or master stabler, a Mr. Thomas
Cranstoun, who had been long in France, and had returned thence
with the Earl in April, appeared, crying, &lsquo;The King has
mounted, and is riding through the Inch,&rsquo; that is, the <!--
page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>Inch of Perth, where the famous clan battle of thirty
men a side had been fought centuries ago.&nbsp; Gowrie shouted
&lsquo;Horses! horses!&rsquo; but Cranstoun said &lsquo;Your
horse is at Scone,&rsquo; some two miles off, on the further side
of the Tay.&nbsp; Why the Earl that day kept his horse so remote,
in times when men of his rank seldom walked, we may conjecture
later (cf. p. 86, <i>infra</i>).</p>
<p>The Earl, however (says Lennox), affected not to hear
Cranstoun, and still shouted &lsquo;Horses!&rsquo;&nbsp; He and
Lennox then passed into the house, through to the front yard, or
Close, and so to the outer gate, giving on the street.&nbsp; Here
Lennox asked the porter, Christie, if the King had gone.&nbsp;
The porter said he was certain that the King had not left the
house.&nbsp; On this point Lindores, who had been with Gowrie and
Lennox in the garden, and accompanied them to the gate, added (as
indeed Lennox also did) that Gowrie now explained to the porter
that James had departed by the back gate.&nbsp; &lsquo;That
cannot be, my Lord,&rsquo; said the porter, &lsquo;for I have the
key of the back gate.&rsquo;&nbsp; Andrew Ray, a bailie of Perth,
who had been in the house, looking on, told the same tale, adding
that Gowrie gave the porter the lie.&nbsp; The porter
corroborated all this at the trial, and quoted his own speech
about the key, as it was given by Lindores.&nbsp; He had the
keys, and must know whether the King had ridden away or not.</p>
<p>In this odd uncertainty, Gowrie said to Lennox, &lsquo;I am
sure the King has gone; but stay, I shall go upstairs, and get
your lordship the very certainty.&rsquo;&nbsp; <!-- page 22--><a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>Gowrie
thereon went from the street door, through the court, and up the
chief staircase of the house, whence he came down again at once,
and anew affirmed to Lennox that &lsquo;the King was forth at the
back gate and away.&rsquo;&nbsp; They all then went out of the
front gate, and stood in the street there, talking, and wondering
where they should seek for his Majesty.</p>
<p>Where was the King?&nbsp; Here we note a circumstance truly
surprising.&nbsp; It never occurred to the Earl of Gowrie, when
dubiously told that the King had &lsquo;loupen
on&rsquo;&mdash;and ridden off&mdash;to ask, <i>Where is the
King&rsquo;s horse</i>?&nbsp; If the Royal nag was in the
Earl&rsquo;s stable, then James had not departed.&nbsp;
Again&mdash;a thing more astonishing still&mdash;it has never
occurred to any of the unnumbered writers on the Gowrie
conspiracy to ask, &lsquo;How did the Earl, if guilty of
falsehood as to the King&rsquo;s departure, mean to get over the
difficulty about the King&rsquo;s horse?&rsquo;&nbsp; If the
horse was in the stable, then the King had not ridden away, as
the Earl declared.&nbsp; Gowrie does not seem to have kidnapped
the horse.&nbsp; We do not hear, from the King, or any one, that
the horse was missing when the Royal party at last rode home.</p>
<p>The author is bound, in honour, to observe that this glaring
difficulty about the horse did not occur to him till he had
written the first draft of this historical treatise, after
reading so many others on the subject.&nbsp; And yet the eagle
glance of Mr. Sherlock Holmes would at once have lighted on his
Majesty&rsquo;s mount.&nbsp; However, neither at the time, nor in
the last three <!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>centuries (as far as we know), was
any one sensible enough to ask &lsquo;How about the King&rsquo;s
horse?&rsquo;</p>
<p>We return to the question, &lsquo;Where was the
King?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Some time had elapsed since he passed silently from the
chamber where he had lunched, through the hall, with the Master,
and so upstairs, &lsquo;going quietly a quiet errand,&rsquo;
Gowrie had explained to the men of the retinue.&nbsp; The
gentlemen had then strolled in the garden, till Cranstoun came
out to them with the news of the King&rsquo;s departure.&nbsp;
Young John Ramsay, one of James&rsquo;s gentlemen, had met the
Laird of Pittencrieff in the hall, and had asked where his
Majesty was.&nbsp; Both had gone upstairs, had examined the fair
gallery filled with pictures collected by the late Earl, and had
remained &lsquo;a certain space&rsquo; admiring it.&nbsp; They
thence went into the front yard, the Close, where Cranstoun met
them and told them that the King had gone.&nbsp; Instead of
joining the gentlemen whom we left loitering and wondering
outside the front gate, on the street, Ramsay ran to the stables
for his horse, he said, and, as he waited at the stable door
(being further from the main entrance than Lennox, Mar, and the
rest), he heard James&rsquo;s voice, &lsquo;but understood not
what he spake.&rsquo; <a name="citation23"></a><a
href="#footnote23" class="citation">[23]</a></p>
<p>The others, on the street, just outside the gate, being nearer
the house than Ramsay, suddenly heard the King&rsquo;s voice, and
even his words.&nbsp; Lennox said to Mar, &lsquo;The King calls,
be he where he will.&rsquo;&nbsp; They all <!-- page 24--><a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>glanced up at
the house, and saw, says Lennox, &lsquo;his Majesty looking out
at the window, hatless, his face red, and a hand gripping his
face and mouth.&rsquo;&nbsp; The King called: &lsquo;I am
murdered.&nbsp; Treason!&nbsp; My Lord of Mar, help,
help!&rsquo;&nbsp; Mar corroborated: Inchaffray saw the King
vanish from the window, &lsquo;and in his judgment, his Majesty
was pulled, perforce, in at the same window.&rsquo;&nbsp; Bailie
Ray of Perth saw the window pushed up, saw the King&rsquo;s face
appear, and heard his cries.&nbsp; Murray of Arbany, who had come
to Perth from another quarter, heard the King.&nbsp; Murray seems
to have been holding the King&rsquo;s falcon on his wrist, in
hall; he had later handed the bird to young Ramsay.</p>
<p>On beholding this vision of the King, hatless, red-faced,
vociferous, and suddenly vanishing, most of his lords and
gentlemen, and Murray of Arbany, rushed through the gate, through
the Close, into the main door of the house, up the broad
staircase, through the long fair gallery, <i>and there they were
stopped by a locked door</i>.&nbsp; They could not reach the
King!&nbsp; Finding a ladder, they used it as a battering-ram,
but it broke in their hands.&nbsp; They sent for hammers, and
during some half an hour they thundered at the door, breaking a
hole in a panel, but unable to gain admission.</p>
<p>Now these facts, as to the locked door, and the inability of
most of the suite to reach the King, are denied by no
author.&nbsp; They make it certain that, if James had contrived a
plot against the two Ruthvens, <!-- page 25--><a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>he had not
taken his two nobles, Mar and Lennox, and these other gentlemen,
and Murray of Arbany, into the scheme.&nbsp; He had not even
arranged that another of his retinue should bring them from their
futile hammer-work, to his assistance, by another way.</p>
<p>For there <i>was</i> another way.&nbsp; Young Ramsay was not
with Lennox and the rest, when they saw and heard the flushed and
excited King cry out of the window.&nbsp; Ramsay, he says, was
further off than the rest; was at the stable door: he heard and
recognised James&rsquo;s voice, but saw nothing of him, and
distinguished no words.&nbsp; He ran into the front yard, through
the outer gate.&nbsp; Lennox and the rest had already vanished
within the house.&nbsp; Ramsay noticed the narrow door in the
wall of the house, giving on the quadrangle, and nearer him than
the main door of entrance, to reach which he must cross the
quadrangle diagonally.&nbsp; He rushed into the narrow doorway,
ran up a dark corkscrew staircase, found a door at the top, heard
a struggling and din of men&rsquo;s feet within, &lsquo;dang
open&rsquo; the door, <i>caught a glimpse of a man behind the
King&rsquo;s back</i>, and saw James and the Master
&lsquo;wrestling together in each other&rsquo;s arms.&rsquo;</p>
<p>James had the Master&rsquo;s head under his arm, the Master,
&lsquo;almost upon his knees,&rsquo; had his hand on the
King&rsquo;s face and mouth.&nbsp; &lsquo;Strike him low,&rsquo;
cried the King, &lsquo;because he wears a secret mail
doublet&rsquo;&mdash;such as men were wont to wear on a doubtful
though <!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>apparently peaceful occasion, like a
Warden&rsquo;s Day on the Border.&nbsp; Ramsay threw down the
King&rsquo;s falcon, which he had taken from Murray and bore on
his wrist, drew his dagger or <i>couteau de chasse</i>, and
struck the Master on the face and neck.&nbsp; The King set his
foot on the falcon&rsquo;s leash, and so held it.&nbsp; Ramsay
might have spared and seized the Master, instead of wounding him;
James later admitted <i>that</i>, but &lsquo;Man,&rsquo; he said,
&lsquo;I had neither God nor the Devil before me, but my own
defence.&rsquo;&nbsp; Remember that hammers were thundering on a
door hard by, and that neither James nor Ramsay knew who knocked
so loud&mdash;enemies or friends.</p>
<p>The King then, says Ramsay, pushed the wounded Master down the
steep narrow staircase up which the young man had run.&nbsp; The
man of whom Ramsay had caught a glimpse, standing behind the
King, had vanished like a wraith.&nbsp; Ramsay went to a window,
looked out, and, seeing Sir Thomas Erskine, cried, &lsquo;Come up
to the top of the staircase.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Where was Erskine, and what was he doing?&nbsp; He had not
followed Lennox and Mar in their rush back into the house.&nbsp;
On hearing James&rsquo;s cries from the window, he and his
brother had tried to seize Gowrie, who had been with the party of
Lennox and Mar.&nbsp; If James was in peril, within
Gowrie&rsquo;s house, they argued, naturally, that Gowrie was
responsible.&nbsp; Not drawing sword or dagger&mdash;daggers,
indeed, they had none&mdash;the two Erskine brothers rushed on
Gowrie, who was crying &lsquo;What is the matter?&nbsp; I know
<!-- page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>nothing!&rsquo;&nbsp; They bore him, or nearly bore him,
to the ground, but his retainers separated the stragglers, and
one, a Ruthven, knocked Sir Thomas down with his fist.&nbsp; The
knight arose, and ran into the front court, where Dr. Herries
asked him &lsquo;what the matter meant.&rsquo;&nbsp; At this
moment Erskine heard Ramsay cry &lsquo;Come up here,&rsquo; from
the top of the narrow dark staircase, he says, <i>not</i> from
the window; Ramsay may have called from both.&nbsp; Erskine, who
was accompanied by the lame Dr. Herries, and by a menial of his
brother&rsquo;s named Wilson, found the bleeding Master near the
foot of the stair, and shouted &lsquo;This is the traitor, strike
him.&rsquo;&nbsp; The stricken lad fell, saying, &lsquo;Alas, I
had not the wyte of it,&rsquo; and the three entered the chamber
where now were only the King and Ramsay.&nbsp; Words, not very
intelligible as reported by Erskine (we consider them later),
passed between him and the King.&nbsp; Though Erskine does not
say so, they shut James up in the turret opening into the chamber
where they were, and instantly Cranstoun, the Earl&rsquo;s
equerry, entered with a drawn sword, followed by Gowrie, with
&lsquo;two swords,&rsquo; while some other persons followed
Gowrie.</p>
<p>Where had Gowrie been since the two Erskines tried to seize
him in the street, and were separated from him by a throng of his
retainers?&nbsp; Why was Gowrie, whose honour was interested in
the King&rsquo;s safety, later in reaching the scene than
Erskine, the limping Dr. Herries, and the serving man,
Wilson?&nbsp; The reason appears to have been that, after the two
<!-- page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>Erskines were separated from Gowrie, Sir Thomas ran
straight from the street, through the gateway, into the front
court of the house, meeting, in the court, Dr. Herries, who was
slow in his movements.&nbsp; But Gowrie, on the other hand, was
detained by certain of Tullibardine&rsquo;s servants, young
Tullibardine being present.&nbsp; This, at least, was the story
given under examination by Mr. Thomas Cranstoun, Gowrie&rsquo;s
master stabler, while other witnesses mention that Gowrie became
involved in a struggle, and went &lsquo;back from&rsquo; his
house, further up or down the street.&nbsp; Young Tullibardine,
present at this fray, was the heir of Murray of Tullibardine, and
ancestor, in the male line, of the present Duke of Atholl.&nbsp;
He later married a niece of the Earl of Gowrie.&nbsp; His father
being a man of forty in 1600, young Tullibardine must have been
very young indeed.&nbsp; The Murrays were in Perth on the
occasion of the marriage of one of their clan, an innkeeper.</p>
<p>Some of their party were in the street, and seeing an
altercation in which two of the King&rsquo;s gentlemen were
prevented from seizing Gowrie, they made an ineffectual effort to
capture the Earl.&nbsp; Gowrie ran from them along the street,
and there &lsquo;drew his two swords out of one scabbard,&rsquo;
says Cranstoun. <a name="citation28"></a><a href="#footnote28"
class="citation">[28]</a>&nbsp; The Earl had just arrived in
Scotland from Italy, where he had acquired the then fashionable
method of fencing with twin-swords, worn in a single
scabbard.&nbsp; <!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>Gowrie, then, had retreated from the
Murrays to the house of one Macbreck, as Cranstoun and Macbreck
himself declared.&nbsp; Cranstoun too drew his sword, and let his
cloak fall, asking Gowrie &lsquo;what the fray was.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The Earl said that &lsquo;he would enter his own house, or die by
the way.&rsquo;&nbsp; Cranstoun said that he would go foremost,
&lsquo;but at whom should he strike, for he knew not who was the
enemy?&rsquo;&nbsp; He had only seen the Erskines collar Gowrie,
then certain Murrays interfere, and he was entirely
puzzled.&nbsp; Gowrie did not reply, and the pair advanced to the
door of the house through a perplexed throng.&nbsp; A servant of
Gowrie&rsquo;s placed a steel cap on his head, and with some four
or five of Gowrie&rsquo;s friends (Hew Moncrieff, Alexander
Ruthven, Harry Ruthven, and Patrick Eviot) the Earl and Cranstoun
entered the front court.</p>
<p>Here Cranstoun saw the body of a man, whether dead or wounded
he knew not, lying at &lsquo;the old turnpike door,&rsquo; the
entry to the dark narrow staircase up which Ramsay had run to the
King&rsquo;s rescue.&nbsp; &lsquo;Who lies there?&rsquo; asked
Cranstoun.&nbsp; Gowrie only replied, &lsquo;Up the
stair!&rsquo;&nbsp; Cranstoun led the way, Gowrie came next; the
other four must have followed, for several witnesses presently
saw them come down again, wounded and bleeding.&nbsp; Cranstoun
found Erskine, Ramsay, and Herries with drawn swords in the
chamber.&nbsp; The King, then in the turret, he did not
see.&nbsp; He taunted Herries; Ramsay and Gowrie crossed swords;
Cranstoun dealt, he says, with <!-- page 30--><a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>Herries,
Erskine, and perhaps Wilson.&nbsp; But, though Cranstoun
&lsquo;nowise knew who followed him,&rsquo; the four men already
named, two Ruthvens, a Moncrieff, and Eviot, were in the fray,
though there was some uncertainty about Eviot. <a
name="citation30"></a><a href="#footnote30"
class="citation">[30]</a></p>
<p>The position of the King, at this moment, was
unenviable.&nbsp; He was shut up in the little round turret
room.&nbsp; On the other side of the door, in the chamber, swords
were clashing, feet were stamping.&nbsp; James knew that he had
four defenders, one of them a lame medical man; who or how many
their opponents might be, he could not know.&nbsp; The air rang
with the thunder of hammers on the door of the chamber where the
fight raged; were they wielded by friends or enemies?&nbsp; From
the turret window the King could hear the town bell ringing, and
see the gathering of the burgesses of Perth, the friends of their
Provost, Gowrie.&nbsp; We know that they could easily muster
eight hundred armed men.&nbsp; Which side would they take?&nbsp;
The Murrays, as we saw, had done nothing, except that some of
them had crowded round Gowrie.&nbsp; Meanwhile there was clash of
steel, stamping of feet, noise of hammers, while the King, in the
turret, knew not how matters were going.</p>
<p>Cranstoun only saw his own part of the fight in the
chamber.&nbsp; How Ramsay and Gowrie sped in their duel he knew
not.&nbsp; Ramsay, he says, turned <!-- page 31--><a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>on
<i>him</i>, and ran him through the body; Herries also struck
him.&nbsp; Of Gowrie he saw nothing; he fled, when wounded, down
the turret stair, his companions following or preceding
him.&nbsp; Gowrie, in fact, had fallen, leaving Ramsay free to
deal with Cranstoun.&nbsp; Writers of both parties declare that
Ramsay had cried to Gowrie, &lsquo;You have slain the
King!&rsquo; that Gowrie dropped his points, and that Ramsay
lunged and ran him through the body.&nbsp; Erskine says that he
himself was wounded in the right hand by Cranstoun; Herries lost
two fingers.&nbsp; When Ramsay ran Gowrie through, the Earl, says
Erskine, fell into the arms of a man whom he himself knew not;
Gowrie&rsquo;s party retreated, but it seems they returned to the
head of the narrow staircase, and renewed hostilities by pushing
swords and halberts under the narrow staircase door.&nbsp; This
appears from the evidence of Lennox.</p>
<p>After pounding at the door so long, Lennox&rsquo;s party at
last sent Robert Brown (a servant of James&rsquo;s, who had
brought the hammers) round to discover another way of reaching
the King.&nbsp; Brown, too, now went up the narrow staircase, and
in the gallery chamber he found the King, with Herries, Erskine,
Ramsay, Wilson, and the dead Earl.&nbsp; He reassured James; the
hammerers were his friends.&nbsp; They handed, says Lennox, one
of the hammers to the King&rsquo;s party, through a shattered
panel, &lsquo;and they within broke the doors, and gave them
entry.&rsquo;&nbsp; At this time, halberts and swords were <!--
page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>being struck, by Gowrie&rsquo;s retainers, under the
door, and through the sides of the door, of the chamber; this
door apparently being that from the chamber to the narrow
staircase.&nbsp; Murray of Arbany (who had come into the house at
the end of dinner) was stricken through the leg by one of these
weapons.&nbsp; Deacon Rhynd of Perth saw Hew Moncrieff striking
with &lsquo;a Jeddart staff,&rsquo; a kind of halbert.&nbsp; A
voice, that of Alexander Ruthven (a cousin of the fallen Earl),
cried &lsquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, my lord, tell me how the Earl
of Gowrie does.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;He is well.&nbsp; Go your
way; you are a fool; you will get no thanks for this
labour,&rsquo; answered Lennox, and all was silence.&nbsp;
Alexander Ruthven and the rest retreated; Ruthven rushed to the
town, rousing the people, and rifling shops in search of
gunpowder.&nbsp; The King and the nobles knelt in prayer on the
bloody floor of the chamber where the dead Gowrie lay.&nbsp; For
some time the confused mob yelled outside, shaking their fists at
the King&rsquo;s party in the window: men and women crying
&lsquo;Come down, Green-coats, ye have committed murder!&nbsp;
Bloody butchers!&rsquo;&nbsp; Others cried &lsquo;The King is
shot!&rsquo;&nbsp; The exits of the house were guarded by
retainers of Gowrie&mdash;Rentoul, Bissett, and others.</p>
<p>Mar and Lennox, from the window, explained to the mob that the
King was well.&nbsp; James showed himself, the magistrates and
nobles pacified the people, who, some armed, some unarmed, were
all perplexed, whether they were anxious about the <!-- page
33--><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>King
or about their Provost, the Earl.&nbsp; From the evidence of
scores of burghers, it appears that the tumult did not last
long.&nbsp; One man was reaping in the Morton haugh.&nbsp;
Hearing the town bell he hastened in, &lsquo;when all the tumult
was ceased,&rsquo; and the magistrates, Ray and others, were
sending the people to their houses, as also did young
Tullibardine.&nbsp; A baker, hearing the bell, went to the town
cross, and so to Gowrie&rsquo;s house, where he met the stream of
people coming away.&nbsp; Another baker was at work, and stayed
with his loaves, otherwise he &lsquo;would have lost his whole
baking.&rsquo;&nbsp; The King represents that it was between
seven and eight in the evening before matters were quiet enough
for him to ride home to Falkland, owing to the tumult.&nbsp; The
citizens doubtless minimised, and James probably exaggerated, the
proportions and duration of the disturbance.</p>

</a></p>
<p>This version of that strange affair, the slaughter of the
Ruthvens, is taken entirely from the lips of sworn
witnesses.&nbsp; We still know no more than we did as to what
passed between the moment when James and the Master, alone, left
the dining chamber, and the moment when the King cried
&lsquo;Treason!&rsquo; out of the turret window.</p>
<p>The problem is, had James lured the Master to Falkland for the
purpose of accompanying him back to Perth, as if by the
Master&rsquo;s invitation, and of there craftily begetting a
brawl, in which Gowrie and the Master should perish at the hands
of Ramsay?&nbsp; Or had the Master, with or without his
brother&rsquo;s knowledge, <!-- page 34--><a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>lured James
to Perth for some evil end?&nbsp; The question divided Scotland;
France and England were sceptical as to the King&rsquo;s
innocence.&nbsp; Our best historians, like Mr. Hill Burton and
Mr. Tytler, side with the King; others are dubious, or believe
that James was the conspirator, and that the Ruthvens were
innocent victims.</p>
<h2><!-- page 35--><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>III.&nbsp; THE KING&rsquo;S OWN NARRATIVE</h2>
<p>So far we have not gained any light on the occurrences of the
mysterious interval between the moment when the King and
Alexander Ruthven passed alone through the hall, after dinner, up
the great staircase, and the moment when the King cried
&lsquo;Treason!&rsquo; out of the turret window.&nbsp; In the
nature of the case, the Master being for ever silent, only James
could give evidence on the events of this interval, James and
<i>one other man</i>, of whose presence in the turret we have
hitherto said little, as only one of the witnesses could swear to
having seen a man there, none to having seen him escaping thence,
or in the tumult.&nbsp; Now the word of James was not to be
relied on, any more than that of the unequalled Elizabeth.&nbsp;
If we take the King&rsquo;s word in this case, it is from no
prejudice in his favour, but merely because his narrative seems
best to fit the facts as given on oath by men like Lennox, Mar,
and other witnesses of all ranks.&nbsp; It also fits, with
discrepancies to be noted, the testimony of <i>the other man</i>,
the man who professed to have been with the Master and the King
in the turret.</p>
<p><!-- page 36--><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>The evidence of that other man was also subject, for
reasons which will appear presently, to the gravest
suspicion.&nbsp; James, if himself guilty of the plot, had to
invent a story to excuse himself; the other man had to adopt the
version of the King, to save his own life from the gibbet.&nbsp;
On the other hand, James, if innocent, could not easily have a
credible story to tell.&nbsp; If the Master was sane, it was
hardly credible that, as James averred, he should menace the King
with murder, in his brother&rsquo;s house, with no traceable
preparations either for flight or for armed resistance.&nbsp; In
James&rsquo;s narrative the Master is made at least to menace the
King with death.&nbsp; However true the King&rsquo;s story might
be, his adversaries, the party of the Kirk and the preachers,
would never accept it.&nbsp; In Lennox&rsquo;s phrase they
&lsquo;liked it not, because it was not likely.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Emphatically it was not likely, but the contradictory story put
forward by the Ruthven apologist, as we shall see, was not only
improbable, but certainly false.</p>
<p>There was living at that time a certain Mr. David Calderwood,
a young Presbyterian minister, aged twenty-five.&nbsp; He was an
avid collector of rumour, of talk, and of actual documents, and
his &lsquo;History of the Kirk of Scotland,&rsquo; composed at a
much later date, is wonderfully copious and accurate.&nbsp; As it
was impossible for King James to do anything at which Calderwood
did not carp, assigning the worst imaginable motives in every
case, we shall find in Calderwood the sum of contemporary hostile
criticism of his <!-- page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>Majesty&rsquo;s narrative.&nbsp; But
the criticism is negative.&nbsp; Calderwood&rsquo;s critics only
pick holes in the King&rsquo;s narrative, but do not advance or
report any other explanation of the events, any complete theory
of the King&rsquo;s plot from the Ruthven side.&nbsp; Any such
story, any such hypothesis, must be to the full as improbable as
the King&rsquo;s narrative.</p>
<p>There is nothing probable in the whole affair; every system,
every hypothesis is <i>difficile &agrave; croire</i>.&nbsp; Yet
the events did occur, and we cannot reject James&rsquo;s account
merely because it is &lsquo;unlikely.&rsquo;&nbsp; The
improbabilities, however, were enormously increased by the
King&rsquo;s theory that the Ruthvens meant to <i>murder</i>
him.&nbsp; This project (not borne out by the King&rsquo;s own
version of Ruthven&rsquo;s conduct) would have been insane: the
Ruthvens, by murdering James, would have roused the whole nation
and the Kirk itself against them.&nbsp; But if their object was
to kidnap James, to secure his person, to separate him from his
Ministers (who were either secretly Catholics, or Indifferents),
and to bring in a new administration favourable to Kirk, or
Church, then the Ruthvens were doing what had several times been
done, and many times attempted.&nbsp; James had been captured
before, even in his own palace, while scores of other plots, to
take him, for instance, when hunting in Falkland woods, remote
from his retinue, had been recently planned, and had
failed.&nbsp; To kidnap the King was the commonest move in
politics; but as James thought, or said, that the idea at Gowrie
House was to <i>murder</i> <!-- page 38--><a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>him, his
tale, even if true, could not be easily credible.</p>
<p>The first narrative was drawn up at Falkland in the night of
August 5.&nbsp; Early on August 6 the letter reached the
Chancellor in Edinburgh, and the contents of the letter were
repeated orally by the Secretary of State (Elphinstone, later
Lord Balmerino) to Nicholson, the English resident at the Court
of Holyrood.&nbsp; Nicholson on the same day reported what he
remembered of what the Secretary remembered of the Falkland
letter, to Cecil.&nbsp; Yet though at third hand
Nicholson&rsquo;s written account of the Falkland letter of
August 5 <a name="citation38"></a><a href="#footnote38"
class="citation">[38]</a> contains the same version as James
later published, with variations so few and so unessential that
it is needless to dwell upon them, they may safely be attributed
to the modifications which a story must suffer in passing through
the memories of two persons.&nbsp; Whatever the amount of truth
in his narrative, the King had it ready at once in the form to
which he adhered, and on which he voluntarily underwent severe
cross-examination, on oath, by Mr. Robert Bruce, one of the
Edinburgh ministers; a point to which we return.</p>
<p>James declares in a later narrative printed and published
about the end of August 1600, that the Master, when he first met
him at Falkland, made a very low bow, which was not his
habit.&nbsp; The Master <!-- page 39--><a name="page39"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 39</span>then said (their conference, we saw,
occupied a quarter of an hour) that, while walking alone on the
previous evening, he had met a cloaked man carrying a great pot,
full of gold in large coined pieces.&nbsp; Ruthven took the
fellow secretly to Gowrie House, &lsquo;locked him <i>in a privy
derned house</i>, and, after locking many doors on him, left him
there and his pot with him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It might be argued that, as the man was said to be locked in a
<i>house</i>, and as James was not taken out of Gowrie House to
see him, James must have known that, when he went upstairs with
the Master, he was not going to see the prisoner.&nbsp; The error
here is that, in the language of the period, a <i>house</i> often
means a <i>room</i>, or chamber.&nbsp; It is so used by James
elsewhere in this very narrative, and endless examples occur in
the letters and books of the period.</p>
<p>Ruthven went on to explain, what greatly needed explanation,
that he had left Perth so early in the morning that James might
have the first knowledge of this secret treasure, concealed
hitherto even from Gowrie.&nbsp; James objected that he had no
right to the gold, which was not treasure trove.&nbsp; Ruthven
replied that, if the King would not take it, others would.&nbsp;
James now began to suspect, very naturally, that the gold was
foreign coin.&nbsp; Indeed, what else could it well be?&nbsp;
Coin from France, Italy, or Spain, brought in often by political
intriguers, was the least improbable sort of minted gold to be
found in poor old Scotland.&nbsp; In the <!-- page 40--><a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>troubles of
1592&ndash;1596 the supplies of the Catholic rebels were in
Spanish money, whereof some was likely enough to be buried by the
owners.&nbsp; James, then, fancied that Jesuits or others had
brought in gold for seditious purposes, &lsquo;as they have
ofttimes done before.&rsquo;&nbsp; Sceptics of the period asked
how one pot of gold could cause a sedition.&nbsp; The question is
puerile.&nbsp; There would be more gold where the potful came
from, if Catholic intrigues were in the air.&nbsp; James then
asked the Master &lsquo;what kind of coin it was.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;They seemed to be foreign and uncouth&rsquo; (unusual)
&lsquo;strokes of coin,&rsquo; said Ruthven, and the man, he
added, was a stranger to him.</p>
<p>James therefore suspected that the man might be a disguised
Scottish priest: the few of them then in Scotland always wore
disguises, as they tell us in their reports to their superiors.
<a name="citation40"></a><a href="#footnote40"
class="citation">[40]</a>&nbsp; The King&rsquo;s inferences as to
<i>popish</i> plotters were thus inevitable, though he may have
emphasised them in his narrative to conciliate the
preachers.&nbsp; His horror of &lsquo;practising Papists,&rsquo;
at this date, was unfeigned.&nbsp; He said to the Master that he
could send a servant with a warrant to Gowrie and the magistrates
of Perth to take and examine the prisoner and his hoard.&nbsp;
Contemporaries asked why he did not &lsquo;commit the credit of
this matter to another.&rsquo;&nbsp; James had anticipated the
objection.&nbsp; He <i>did</i> propose this course, but Ruthven
replied that, if others once touched the money, the <!-- page
41--><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>King
&lsquo;would get a very bad account made to him of that
treasure.&rsquo;&nbsp; He implored his Majesty to act as he
advised, and not to forget him afterwards.&nbsp; This suggestion
may seem mean in Ruthven, but the age was not disinterested, nor
was Ruthven trying to persuade a high-souled man.&nbsp; The King
was puzzled and bored, &lsquo;the morning was fair, the game
already found,&rsquo; the monarch was a keen sportsman, so he
said that he would think the thing over and answer at the end of
the hunt.</p>
<p>Granting James&rsquo;s notorious love of disentangling a
mystery, granting his love of money, and of hunting, I agree with
Mr. Tytler in seeing nothing improbable in this narration.&nbsp;
If the Master wanted to lure the King to Perth, I cannot conceive
a better device than the tale which, according to the King, he
told.&nbsp; The one improbable point, considering the morals of
the country, was that Ruthven should come to James, in place of
sharing the gold with his brother.&nbsp; But Ruthven, we shall
see, had possibly good reasons, known to James, for conciliating
the Royal favour, and for keeping his brother ignorant.&nbsp;
Moreover, to seize the money would not have been a safe thing for
Ruthven to do; the story would have leaked out, questions would
have been asked.&nbsp; James had hit on the only plausible theory
to account for a low fellow with a pot of gold; he <i>must</i> be
&lsquo;a practising Papist.&rsquo;&nbsp; James could neither
suppose, nor expect others to believe that he supposed, one pot
of foreign gold enough &lsquo;to bribe the country into <!-- page
42--><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>rebellion.&rsquo;&nbsp; But the pot, and the prisoner,
supplied a clue worth following.&nbsp; Probabilities strike
different critics in different ways.&nbsp; Mr. Tytler thinks
James&rsquo;s tale true, and that he acted in character.&nbsp;
That is my opinion; his own the reader must form for himself.</p>
<p>Ruthven still protested.&nbsp; This hunt of gold was well
worth a buck!&nbsp; The prisoner, he said, might attract
attention by his cries, a very weak argument, but Ruthven was
quite as likely to invent it on the spur of the moment, as James
was to attribute it to him falsely, on cool reflection.&nbsp;
Finally, if James came at once, Gowrie would then be at the
preaching (Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Sundays were preaching days),
and the Royal proceedings with the captive would be
undisturbed.</p>
<p>Now, on the hypothesis of intended kidnapping, this was a
well-planned affair.&nbsp; If James accepted Ruthven&rsquo;s
invitation, he, with three or four servants, would reach Gowrie
House while the town of Perth was quiet.&nbsp; Nothing would be
easier than to seclude him, seize his person, and transport him
to the seaside, either by Tay, or down the north bank of that
river, or in <!-- page 43--><a name="page43"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 43</span>disguise across Fife, to the Firth of
Forth, in the retinue of Gowrie, before alarm was created at
Falkland.&nbsp; Gowrie had given out (so his friends declared)
that he was to go that night to Dirleton, his castle near North
Berwick, <a name="citation42"></a><a href="#footnote42"
class="citation">[42]</a> a strong hold, manned, and
provisioned.&nbsp; Could he have carried the King in disguise
across Fife to Elie, Dirleton was within a twelve miles sail, on
summer seas.&nbsp; Had James&rsquo;s curiosity and avarice led
him to ride away at once with Ruthven, and three or four
servants, the plot might have succeeded.&nbsp; We must criticise
the plot on these lines.&nbsp; Thus, if at all, had the Earl and
his brother planned it.&nbsp; But Fate interfered, the unexpected
occurred&mdash;<i>but the plot could not be dropped</i>.&nbsp;
The story of the pot of gold could not be explained away.&nbsp;
The King, with royal rudeness, did not even reply to the new
argument of the Master.&nbsp; &lsquo;Without any further
answering him,&rsquo; his Majesty mounted, Ruthven staying still
in the place where the King left him.&nbsp; At this moment
Inchaffray, as we saw, met Ruthven, and invited him to breakfast,
but he said that he was ordered to wait on the King.</p>
<p>At this point, James&rsquo;s narrative contains a circumstance
which, confessedly, was not within his own experience.&nbsp; He
did not know, he says, that the Master had any companion.&nbsp;
But, from the evidence of another, he learned that the Master had
a companion, indeed two companions.&nbsp; One was Andrew Ruthven,
about whose presence nobody doubts.&nbsp; The other, one Andrew
Henderson, was not seen by James at this time.&nbsp; However, the
King says, on Henderson&rsquo;s own evidence, that the Master now
sent him (about seven o&rsquo;clock) to warn Gowrie that the King
was to come.&nbsp; Really it seems that Henderson was despatched
rather later, during the first check in the run.</p>
<p>It was all-important to the King&rsquo;s case to prove <!--
page 44--><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>that Henderson had been at Falkland, and had returned at
once with a message to Gowrie, for this would demonstrate that,
in appearing to be unprepared for the King&rsquo;s arrival (as he
did), Gowrie was making a false pretence.&nbsp; It was also
important to prove that the ride of Ruthven and Henderson to
Falkland and back had been concealed, by them, from the people at
Gowrie House.&nbsp; Now this <i>was</i> proved.&nbsp;
Craigengelt, Gowrie&rsquo;s steward, who was tortured, tried,
convicted, and hanged, deponed that, going up the staircase, just
after the King&rsquo;s arrival, he met the Master, booted, and
asked &lsquo;where he had been.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;An errand not
far off,&rsquo; said the Master, concealing his long ride to
Falkland. <a name="citation44a"></a><a href="#footnote44a"
class="citation">[44a]</a>&nbsp; Again, John Moncrieff, a
gentleman who was with Gowrie, asked Henderson (who had returned
to Perth much earlier than the King&rsquo;s arrival) where he had
been, and he said &lsquo;that he had been two or three miles
above the town.&rsquo; <a name="citation44b"></a><a
href="#footnote44b" class="citation">[44b]</a>&nbsp; Henderson
himself later declared that Gowrie had told him to keep his ride
to Falkland secret. <a name="citation44c"></a><a
href="#footnote44c" class="citation">[44c]</a>&nbsp; The whole
purpose of all this secrecy was to hide the fact that the
Ruthvens had brought the King to Perth, and that Gowrie had early
notice, by about 10 a.m., of James&rsquo;s approach, from
Henderson.&nbsp; Therefore to make out that Henderson had been in
Falkland, and had given Gowrie early notice of James&rsquo;s
approach, though Gowrie for all that made <!-- page 45--><a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>no
preparations to welcome James, was almost necessary for the
Government.&nbsp; They specially questioned all witnesses on this
point.&nbsp; Yet not one of their witnesses would swear to having
seen Henderson at Falkland.&nbsp; This disposes of the theory of
wholesale perjury.</p>
<p>The modern apologist for the Ruthvens, Mr. Louis Barb&eacute;,
writes: &lsquo;We believe that Henderson perjured himself in
swearing that he accompanied Alexander&rsquo; (the Master)
&lsquo;and Andrew Ruthven when . . . they rode to Falkland.&nbsp;
We believe that Henderson perjured himself when he asserted, on
oath, that the Master sent him back to Perth with the
intelligence of the King&rsquo;s coming.&rsquo; <a
name="citation45"></a><a href="#footnote45"
class="citation">[45]</a></p>
<p>On the other hand, George Hay, lay Prior of the famous
Chartreux founded by James I in Perth, deponed that Henderson
arrived long before Gowrie&rsquo;s dinner, and Peter Hay
corroborated.&nbsp; But Hay averred that Gowrie asked Henderson
&lsquo;who was at Falkland with the King?&rsquo;&nbsp; It would
not follow that Henderson had been at Falkland himself.&nbsp;
John Moncrieff deponed that Gowrie said nothing of
Henderson&rsquo;s message, but sat at dinner, feigning to have no
knowledge of the King&rsquo;s approach, till the Master arrived,
a few minutes before the King.&nbsp; Mr. Rhynd, Gowrie&rsquo;s
tutor, deponed that Andrew Ruthven (the Master&rsquo;s other
companion in the early ride to Falkland) told him that the Master
had sent on Henderson with news of the King&rsquo;s coming.&nbsp;
If Henderson had <!-- page 46--><a name="page46"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 46</span>been at Falkland, he had some four
hours&rsquo; start of the King and his party, and must have
arrived at Perth, and spoken to Gowrie, long before dinner, he
himself says at 10 a.m.&nbsp; Dinner was at noon, or, on this
day, half an hour later.&nbsp; Yet Gowrie made no preparations
for welcoming the King.</p>
<p>It is obvious that, though the Hays and Moncrieff both saw
Henderson return, booted, from a ride somewhere or other, at an
early hour, none of them could <i>prove</i> that he had ridden to
Falkland and back.&nbsp; There was, in fact, no evidence that
Henderson had been at Falkland except his own, and that of the
poor tortured tutor, Rhynd, to the effect that Andrew Ruthven had
confessed as much to him.&nbsp; But presently we shall find that,
while modern apologists for Gowrie deny that Henderson had been
at Falkland, the contemporary Ruthven apologist insists that he
had been there.</p>
<p>To return to James&rsquo;s own narrative, he asserts
Henderson&rsquo;s presence at Falkland, but not from his own
knowledge.&nbsp; He did not see Henderson at Falkland.&nbsp;
Ruthven, says James, sent Henderson to Gowrie just after the King
mounted and followed the hounds.&nbsp; Here it must be noted that
Henderson himself says that Ruthven did not actually despatch him
till after he had some more words with the King.&nbsp; This is an
instance of James&rsquo;s <i>insouciance</i> as to harmonising
his narrative with Henderson&rsquo;s, or causing Henderson to
conform to his.&nbsp; &lsquo;Cooked&rsquo; evidence, collusive
evidence, would have avoided <!-- page 47--><a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>these
discrepancies.&nbsp; James says that, musing over the story of
the pot of gold, he sent one Naismith, a surgeon (he had been
with James at least since 1592), to bring Ruthven to him, during
a check, and told Ruthven that he would, after the hunt, come to
Perth.&nbsp; James thought that this was <i>after</i> the
despatch of Henderson, but probably it was before, to judge by
Henderson&rsquo;s account.</p>
<p>During this pause, the hounds having hit on the scent again,
the King was left behind, but spurred on.&nbsp; At every check,
the Master kept urging him to make haste, so James did not tarry
to break up the deer, as usual.&nbsp; The kill was but two
bowshots from the stables, and the King did not wait for his
sword, or his second horse, which had to gallop a mile before it
reached him.&nbsp; Mar, Lennox, and others did wait for their
second mounts, some rode back to Falkland for fresh horses, some
dragged slowly along on tired steeds, and did not rejoin James
till later.</p>
<p>Ruthven had tried, James says, to induce him to refuse the
company of the courtiers.&nbsp; Three or four servants, he said,
would be enough.&nbsp; The others &lsquo;might mar the whole
purpose.&rsquo;&nbsp; James was &lsquo;half angry,&rsquo; he
began to entertain odd surmises about Ruthven.&nbsp; One was
&lsquo;it might be that the Earl his brother <i>had handled him
so hardly</i>, that the young gentleman, being of a high spirit,
had taken such displeasure, as he was become somewhat beside
himself.&rsquo;&nbsp; But why should Gowrie handle his brother
hardly?</p>
<p>The answer is suggested by an unpublished contemporary <!--
page 48--><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>manuscript, &lsquo;The True Discovery of the late
Treason,&rsquo; <a name="citation48a"></a><a href="#footnote48a"
class="citation">[48a]</a> &amp;c.&nbsp; &lsquo;Some offence had
passed betwixt the said Mr. Alexander Ruthven&rsquo; (the Master)
&lsquo;and his brother, for that the said Alexander, both of
himself and by his Majesty&rsquo;s mediation, had craved of the
Earl his brother the demission and release of the Abbey of Scone,
which his Majesty had bestowed upon the said Earl during his
life. . . .&nbsp; His suit had little success.&rsquo; <a
name="citation48b"></a><a href="#footnote48b"
class="citation">[48b]</a></p>
<p>If this be fact (and there is no obvious reason for its
invention), James might have reason to suspect that Gowrie had
&lsquo;handled his brother hardly:&rsquo; Scone being a valuable
estate, well worth keeping.&nbsp; To secure the King&rsquo;s
favour as to Scone, Ruthven had a motive, as James would
understand, for making him, and not Gowrie, acquainted with the
secret of the treasure.&nbsp; Thus the unpublished manuscript
casually explains the reason of the King&rsquo;s suspicion that
the Earl might have &lsquo;handled the Master hardly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>On some such surmise, James asked Lennox (who corroborates)
whether he thought the Master quite &lsquo;settled in his
wits.&rsquo;&nbsp; Lennox knew nothing but good of him (as he
said in his evidence), but Ruthven, observing their private talk,
implored James to keep the secret, and come <i>alone</i> with
him&mdash;at first&mdash;to see the captive and the
treasure.&nbsp; James felt more and more uneasy, but he had
started, and rode on, while <!-- page 49--><a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>the Master
now despatched Andrew Ruthven to warn Gowrie.&nbsp; Within a mile
of Perth the Master spurred on his weary horse, and gave the news
to Gowrie, who, despite the messages of Henderson and Andrew
Ruthven, was at dinner, unprepared for the Royal arrival.&nbsp;
However, Gowrie met James with sixty men (four, says the Ruthven
apologist).</p>
<p>James&rsquo;s train then consisted of fifteen persons.&nbsp;
Others must have dropped in later: they had no fresh mounts, but
rested their horses, the King says, and let them graze by the
way.&nbsp; They followed because, learning that James was going
to Perth, they guessed that he intended to apprehend the Master
of Oliphant, who had been misconducting himself in Angus.&nbsp;
Thus the King accounts for the number of his train.</p>
<p>An hour passed before dinner: James pressed for a view of the
treasure, but the Master asked the King not to converse with him
then, as the whole affair was to be kept secret from
Gowrie.&nbsp; If the two brothers had been at odds about the
lands of Scone, the Master&rsquo;s attitude towards his brother
might seem intelligible, a point never allowed for by critics
unacquainted with the manuscript which we have cited.&nbsp; At
last the King sat down to dinner, Gowrie in attendance,
whispering to his servants, <i>and often going in and out of the
chamber</i>.&nbsp; The Master, too, was seen on the stairs by
Craigengelt.</p>
<p>If Gowrie&rsquo;s behaviour is correctly described, it might
be attributed to anxiety about a Royal meal <!-- page 50--><a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>so hastily
prepared.&nbsp; But if Gowrie had plenty of warning, from
Henderson (as I do not doubt), that theory is not
sufficient.&nbsp; If engaged in a conspiracy, Gowrie would have
reason for anxiety.&nbsp; The circumstances, owing to the number
of the royal retinue, were unfavourable, yet, as the story of the
pot of gold had been told by Ruthven, the plot could not be
abandoned.&nbsp; James even &lsquo;chaffed&rsquo; Gowrie about
being so pensive and <i>distrait</i>, and about his neglect of
some little points of Scottish etiquette.&nbsp; Finally he sent
Gowrie into the hall, with the grace-cup for the gentlemen, and
then called the Master.&nbsp; He sent Gowrie, apparently, that he
might slip off with the Master, as that gentleman wished.&nbsp;
&lsquo;His Majesty desired Mr. Alexander to bring Sir Thomas
Erskine with him, who&rsquo; (Ruthven) &lsquo;desiring the King
to go forward with him, and promising that he should make any one
or two follow him that he pleased to call for, desiring his
Majesty to command <i>publicly</i> that none should follow
him.&rsquo;&nbsp; This seems to mean, James and the Master were
to cross the hall and go upstairs; James, or the Master for him,
bidding no one follow (the Master, according to Balgonie, did say
that the King would be alone), while, presently, the Master
should return and privately beckon on one or two to join the
King.&nbsp; The Master&rsquo;s excuse for all this was the
keeping from Gowrie and others, for the moment, of the secret of
the prisoner and the pot of gold.</p>
<p>Now, if we turn back to Sir Thomas Erskine&rsquo;s <!-- page
51--><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>evidence, we find that, when he joined James in the
chamber, after the slaying of the Master, he said &lsquo;I
thought your Majesty would have concredited more to me, than to
have commanded me to await your Majesty at the door, if you
thought it not meet to have taken me with you.&rsquo;&nbsp; The
King replied, &lsquo;Alas, the traitor deceived me in that, as in
all else, for I commanded him expressly to bring you to me, and
he returned back, as I thought, to fetch you, but he did nothing
but <i>steik</i> [shut] the door.&rsquo;</p>
<p>What can these words mean?&nbsp; They appear to me to imply
that James sent the Master back, according to their arrangement,
to bring Erskine, that the Master gave Erskine some invented
message about waiting at some door, that he then shut a door
between the King and his friends, but told the King that Erskine
was to follow them.&nbsp; Erskine was, beyond doubt, in the
street with the rest of the retinue, before the brawl in the
turret reached its crisis, when Gowrie had twice insisted that
James had ridden away.</p>
<p>In any case, to go on with James&rsquo;s tale, he went with
Ruthven up a staircase (the great staircase), &lsquo;and through
three or four rooms&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;three or four sundry
<i>houses</i>&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;the Master ever locking behind
him every door as he passed, and so into a little
study&rsquo;&mdash;the turret.&nbsp; This is perplexing.&nbsp; We
nowhere hear in the evidence of more than two doors, in the
suite, which were locked.&nbsp; The staircase perhaps gave on the
long gallery, with a door between them.&nbsp; The <!-- page
52--><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span>gallery gave on a chamber, which had a door (the door
battered by Lennox and Mar), and the chamber gave on a turret,
which had a door between it and the chamber.</p>
<p>We hear, in the evidence, of no other doors, or of no other
locked doors.&nbsp; However, in the Latin indictment of the
Ruthvens, &lsquo;many doors&rsquo; are insisted on.&nbsp; As all
the evidence tells of opposition from only <i>one</i>
door&mdash;that between the gallery and the chamber of
death&mdash;James&rsquo;s reason for talking of &lsquo;three or
four doors&rsquo; must be left to conjecture.&nbsp; &lsquo;The
True Discourse&rsquo; (MS.) gives but the gallery, chamber, and
turret, but appears to allow for a door between stair and
gallery, which the Master &lsquo;closed,&rsquo; while he
&lsquo;made fast&rsquo; the next door, that between gallery and
chamber.&nbsp; One Thomas Hamilton, <a name="citation52a"></a><a
href="#footnote52a" class="citation">[52a]</a> who writes a long
letter (MS.) to a lady unknown, also speaks of several doors, on
the evidence of the King, and some of the Lords.&nbsp; This
manuscript has been neglected by historians. <a
name="citation52b"></a><a href="#footnote52b"
class="citation">[52b]</a></p>
<p>Leaving this point, we ask why a man already suspicious, like
James, let the Master lock any door behind him.&nbsp; We might
reply that James had dined, and that &lsquo;wine and beer produce
a careless state of mind,&rsquo; as a writer on cricket long ago
observed.&nbsp; We may also suppose that, till facts proved the
locking of one door at least (for about that there is no doubt),
James did not know that any door <i>was</i> <!-- page 53--><a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>locked.&nbsp;
On August 11 the Rev. Mr. Galloway, in a sermon preached before
the King and the populace at the Cross of Edinburgh, says that
the Master led the monarch upstairs, &lsquo;and through a
<i>trans</i>&rsquo; (a passage), &lsquo;the door whereof, so soon
as they had entered, <i>chekit to with ane lok</i>, then through
a gallery, whose door also <i>chekit to</i>, through a chamber,
and the door thereof <i>chekit to</i>, also,&rsquo; and thence
into the turret of which he &lsquo;also locked the door.&rsquo;
<a name="citation53"></a><a href="#footnote53"
class="citation">[53]</a></p>
<p>Were the locks that &lsquo;chekit to&rsquo; spring locks, and
was James unaware that he was locked in?&nbsp; But Ramsay, before
the affray, had wandered into &lsquo;a gallery, very fair,&rsquo;
and unless there were two galleries, he could not do this, if the
gallery door was locked.&nbsp; Lennox and Mar and the rest speak
of opposition from only one door.</p>
<p>While we cannot explain these things, <i>that</i> door, at
least, between the gallery and the gallery chamber, excluded
James from most of his friends.&nbsp; Can the reader believe that
he purposely had that door locked, we know not how, or by whom,
on the system of compelling Gowrie to &lsquo;come and be
killed&rsquo; by way of the narrow staircase?&nbsp; Could we see
Gowrie House, and its &lsquo;secret ways,&rsquo; as it then was,
we might understand this problem of the locked doors.&nbsp;
Contemporary criticism, as minutely recorded by Calderwood, found
no fault with the number of locked doors, but only asked
&lsquo;how could the King&rsquo;s fear but increase, perceiving
Mr. Alexander&rsquo; (the <!-- page 54--><a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>Master)
&lsquo;ever to lock the doors behind them?&rsquo;&nbsp; If the
doors closed with spring locks (of which the principle had long
been understood and used), the King may not have been aware of
the locking.&nbsp; The problem cannot be solved; we only
disbelieve that the King himself had the door locked, to keep his
friends out, and let Gowrie in.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Note</span>.&mdash;<i>The Abbey of
Scone</i>.&nbsp; On page 48 we have quoted the statement that
James had bestowed on Gowrie the Abbey of Scone &lsquo;during his
life.&rsquo;&nbsp; This was done in 1580 (<i>Registrum Magni
Sigilli</i>, vol. iii.&nbsp; No. 3011).&nbsp; On May 25, 1584,
William Fullarton got this gift, the first Earl of Gowrie and his
children being then forfeited.&nbsp; But on July 23, 1586, the
Gowrie of the day was restored to all his lands, and the Earldom
of Gowrie included the old church lands of Scone (<i>Reg. Mag.
Sig.</i> iv. No. 695, No. 1044).&nbsp; How, then, did John, third
Earl of Gowrie, hold only &lsquo;for his life&rsquo; the
Commendatorship of the Abbey of Scone, as is stated in S. P.
Scot.&nbsp; (Eliz.) vol. lxvi.&nbsp; No. 50?</p>
<h2><!-- page 55--><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>IV.&nbsp; THE KING&rsquo;S NARRATIVE&mdash;II.&nbsp; THE
MAN IN THE TURRET</h2>
<p>We left James entering the little &lsquo;round,&rsquo; or
&lsquo;study,&rsquo; the turret chamber.&nbsp; Here, at last, he
expected to find the captive and the pot of gold.&nbsp; And here
the central mystery of his adventure began.&nbsp; His Majesty saw
standing, &lsquo;with a very abased countenance, not a bondman
but a freeman, with a dagger at his girdle.&rsquo;&nbsp; Ruthven
locked the door, put on his hat, drew the man&rsquo;s dagger, and
held the point to the King&rsquo;s breast, &lsquo;<i>avowing now
that the King behoved to be at his will</i>, <i>and used as he
list</i>; swearing many bloody oaths that if the King cried one
word, or opened a window to look out, that dagger should go to
his heart.&rsquo;</p>
<p>If this tale is true, murder was not intended, unless James
resisted: the King was only being <i>threatened</i> into
compliance with the Master&rsquo;s &lsquo;will.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Ruthven added that the King&rsquo;s conscience must now be
burthened &lsquo;for murdering his father,&rsquo; that is, for
the execution of William, Earl of Gowrie, in 1584.&nbsp; <!--
page 56--><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>His conviction was believed to have been procured in a
dastardly manner, later to be explained.</p>
<p>James was unarmed, and obviously had no secret coat of mail,
in which he could not have hunted all day, perhaps.&nbsp; Ruthven
had his sword; as for the other man he stood &lsquo;trembling and
quaking.&rsquo;&nbsp; James now made to the Master the odd
harangue reported even in Nicholson&rsquo;s version of the
Falkland letter of the same day.&nbsp; As for Gowrie&rsquo;s
execution, the King said, he had then been a minor (he was
eighteen in 1584), and Gowrie was condemned &lsquo;by the
ordinary course of law&rsquo;&mdash;which his friends
denied.&nbsp; James had restored, he said, all the lands and
dignities of the House, two of Ruthven&rsquo;s sisters were maids
of honour.&nbsp; Ruthven had been educated by the revered Mr.
Rollock, he ought to have learned better behaviour.&nbsp; If the
King died he would be avenged: Gowrie could not hope for the
throne.&nbsp; The King solemnly promised forgiveness and silence,
if Ruthven let him go.</p>
<p>Ruthven now uncovered his head, and protested that the
King&rsquo;s life should be safe, if he made no noise or cry: in
that case Ruthven would now bring Gowrie to him.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Why?&rsquo; asked James; &lsquo;you could gain little by
keeping such a prisoner?&rsquo;&nbsp; Ruthven said that he could
not explain; Gowrie would tell him the rest.&nbsp; Turning to
<i>the other man</i>, he said &lsquo;I make you the King&rsquo;s
keeper till I come again, and see that you keep him upon your
peril.&rsquo;&nbsp; He then went out, and locked the door.&nbsp;
The person who later averred that he had been the man in the
turret, <!-- page 57--><a name="page57"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 57</span>believed that Ruthven never went far
from the door.&nbsp; James believed, indeed averred, that he ran
downstairs, and consulted Gowrie.</p>
<p>If there was an armed man in the turret, he was either placed
there by the King, to protect him while he summoned his minions
by feigned cries of treason, or he was placed there by Gowrie to
help the Master to seize the King.&nbsp; In the latter case, the
Master&rsquo;s position was now desperate; in lieu of an ally he
had procured a witness against himself.&nbsp; Great need had he
to consult Gowrie, but though Gowrie certainly entered the house,
went upstairs, and returned to Lennox with the assurance that
James had ridden away, it is improbable that he and his brother
met at this moment.&nbsp; James, however, avers that they met,
Ruthven running rapidly downstairs, but this was mere inference
on the King&rsquo;s part.</p>
<p>James occupied the time of Ruthven&rsquo;s absence in asking
the man of the turret what he knew of the conspiracy.&nbsp; The
man replied that he knew nothing, he had but recently been locked
into the little chamber.&nbsp; Indeed, while Ruthven was
threatening, the man (says James) was trembling, and adjuring the
Master not to harm the King.&nbsp; James, having sworn to Ruthven
that he would not open the window himself, now,
characteristically, asked the man to open the window &lsquo;on
his right hand.&rsquo;&nbsp; If the King had his back to the
turret door, the window on his right opened on the courtyard, the
window on his left opened on the street.&nbsp; The <!-- page
58--><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>man
readily opened the window, says the King, and the person claiming
to be the man deponed later that he first opened what the King
declared to be the wrong window, but, before he could open the
other, in came the Master, who, &lsquo;casting his hands abroad
in desperate manner, said &ldquo;he could not mend it, his
Majesty behoved to die.&rdquo;&rsquo;&nbsp; Instead of stabbing
James, however, he tried to bind the Royal hands with a garter,
&lsquo;swearing he behoved to be bound.&rsquo;&nbsp; (A garter
was later picked up on the floor by one of the witnesses, Graham
of Balgonie, and secured by Sir Thomas Erskine. <a
name="citation58"></a><a href="#footnote58"
class="citation">[58]</a>)</p>
<p>A struggle then began, James keeping the Master&rsquo;s right
hand off his sword-hilt; the Master trying to silence James with
his left hand.&nbsp; James dragged the Master to the window,
which the other man had opened.&nbsp; (In the Latin indictment of
the dead Ruthvens, James opens the window himself.)&nbsp; The
turret man said, in one of two depositions, that he stretched
across the wrestlers, and opened the window.&nbsp; The retinue
and Gowrie were passing, as we know, or loitering below; Gowrie
affected not to hear the cries of treason; Lennox, Mar, and the
rest rushed up the great staircase.&nbsp; Meanwhile, struggling
with the Master, James had brought him out of the turret into the
chamber, so he says, though, more probably, the Master brought
<i>him</i>.&nbsp; They were now <!-- page 59--><a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>near the door
of the chamber that gave on the narrow staircase, and James was
&lsquo;throwing the Master&rsquo;s sword out of his hand,
thinking to have stricken him therewith,&rsquo; when Ramsay
entered, and wounded the Master, who was driven down the stairs,
and there killed by Erskine and Herries.&nbsp; Gowrie then
invaded the room with seven others: James was looking for the
Master&rsquo;s sword, <a name="citation59"></a><a
href="#footnote59" class="citation">[59]</a> which had fallen,
but he was instantly shut into the turret by his friends, and saw
none of the fight in which Gowrie fell.&nbsp; After that Lennox
and the party with hammers were admitted, and&mdash;the tumult
appeased&mdash;James rode back, through a dark rainy night, to
Falkland.</p>

60</span>V.&nbsp; HENDERSON&rsquo;S NARRATIVE</h2>
<p>The man in the turret had vanished like a ghost.&nbsp;
Henderson, on the day after the tragedy, was also not to be
found.&nbsp; Like certain Ruthvens, Hew Moncrieff, Eviot, and
others, who had fought in the death-chamber, or been
distinguished in the later riot, Henderson had fled.&nbsp; He
was, though a retainer of Gowrie, a member of the Town Council of
Perth, and &lsquo;chamberlain,&rsquo; or &lsquo;factor,&rsquo; of
the lands of Scone, then held by Gowrie from the King.&nbsp; To
find any one who had seen him during the tumult was difficult or
impossible.&nbsp; William Robertson, a notary of Perth, examined
in November before the Parliamentary Committee, said then that he
only saw Gowrie, with his two drawn swords, and seven or eight
companions, in the forecourt of the house, and so, &lsquo;being
afraid, he passed out of the place.&rsquo;&nbsp; The same man,
earlier, on September 23, when examined with other citizens of
Perth, had said that he followed young Tullibardine and some of
his men, who were entering the court &lsquo;to relieve the
King.&rsquo; <a name="citation60"></a><a href="#footnote60"
class="citation">[60]</a>&nbsp; He saw the Master lying dead at
the foot of the stair, and saw Henderson <!-- page 61--><a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>&lsquo;come
out of the said turnpike, over the Master&rsquo;s
belly.&rsquo;&nbsp; He spoke to Henderson, who did not
answer.&nbsp; He remembered that Murray of Arbany was
present.&nbsp; Arbany, before the Parliamentary Committee in
November, said nothing on this subject, <i>nor did
Robertson</i>.&nbsp; His evidence would have been important, had
he adhered to what he said on September 23.&nbsp; But, oddly
enough, if he perjured himself on the earlier occasion (September
23), he withdrew his perjury, when it would have been useful to
the King&rsquo;s case, in the evidence given before the Lords of
the Articles, in November.&nbsp; Mr. Barb&eacute;, perhaps misled
by the sequence of versions in Pitcairn, writes:
&lsquo;Apparently it was only when his memory had been stimulated
by the treatment of those whose evidence was found to be
favourable to the King that the wily notary recalled the details
by which he intended to corroborate Henderson&rsquo;s statement.
. . . &rsquo; <a name="citation61a"></a><a href="#footnote61a"
class="citation">[61a]</a></p>
<p>The reverse is the case: the wily notary did not offer, at the
trial in November, the evidence which he had given, in September,
at the examination of the citizens of Perth.&nbsp; It may perhaps
be inferred that perjury was not encouraged, but depressed. <a
name="citation61b"></a><a href="#footnote61b"
class="citation">[61b]</a></p>
<p><!-- page 62--><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>Despite the premiums on perjury which Ruthven apologists
insist on, not one witness would swear to having seen Henderson
during or after the tumult.&nbsp; Yet he instantly fled, with
others who had been active in the brawl, and remained in
concealment.&nbsp; Calderwood, the earnest collector of
contemporary gossip and documents, assures us that when the man
in the turret could not be found, the first proclamation
identified him with a Mr. Robert Oliphant, a &lsquo;black grim
man,&rsquo; but that Oliphant proved his absence from
Perth.&nbsp; One Gray and one Lesley were also suspected, and one
Younger (hiding when sought for, it is said) was killed.&nbsp;
But we have no copy of the proclamation as to Mr. Robert
Oliphant.&nbsp; To Mr. Robert Oliphant, who had an alibi, we
shall return, for this gentleman, though entirely overlooked by
our historians, was probably at the centre of the situation (p.
71, <i>infra</i>).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, whatever Henderson had done, he mysteriously
vanished from Gowrie House, during or after the turmoil,
&lsquo;following darkness like a dream.&rsquo;&nbsp; Nobody was
produced who could say anything about seeing Henderson, after
Moncrieff and the Hays saw <!-- page 63--><a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>him on his
return from Falkland, at about ten o&rsquo;clock in the morning
of August 5.</p>
<p>By August 12, Henderson was still in hiding, and was still
being proclaimed for, with others, of whom Mr. Robert Oliphant
was not one: they were Moncrieff, Eviot, and two Ruthvens. <a
name="citation63a"></a><a href="#footnote63a"
class="citation">[63a]</a>&nbsp; But, on August 11 at the Cross
of Edinburgh, in presence of the King, his chaplain, the Rev.
Patrick Galloway, gave news of Henderson.&nbsp; Mr. Galloway had
been minister of Perth, and a fierce Presbyterian of old.</p>
<blockquote><p>Blow, Galloway, the trumpet of the Lord!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>exclaimed a contemporary poet.&nbsp; But James had tamed
Galloway, he was now the King&rsquo;s chaplain, he did not blow
the trumpet of the Lord any longer, and, I fear, was capable of
anything.&nbsp; He had a pension, Calderwood tells us, from the
lands of Scone, and knew Henderson, who, as Chamberlain, or
steward, paid the money.&nbsp; In his exciting sermon, Galloway
made a dramatic point.&nbsp; Henderson was found, and Henderson
was the man in the turret!&nbsp; Galloway had received a letter
from Henderson, in his own hand; any listener who knew
Henderson&rsquo;s hand might see the letter.&nbsp; Henderson
tells his tale therein; Galloway says that it differs almost
nothing from the King&rsquo;s story, of which he had given an
abstract in his discourse.&nbsp; And he adds that Henderson stole
downstairs while Ramsay was engaged with the Master. <a
name="citation63b"></a><a href="#footnote63b"
class="citation">[63b]</a></p>
<p><!-- page 64--><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>Henderson, being now in touch with Galloway, probably
received promise of his life, and of reward, for he came in
before August 20, and, at the trial in November, was relieved of
the charge of treason, and gave evidence.</p>
<p>Here we again ask, Why did Henderson take to flight?&nbsp;
What had he to do with the matter?&nbsp; None fled but those who
had been seen, sword in hand, in the fatal chamber, or
stimulating the populace to attack the King during the
tumult.&nbsp; Andrew Ruthven, who had ridden to Falkland with
Henderson and the Master, did not run away, no proclamation for
<i>him</i> is on record.&nbsp; Nobody swore to seeing Henderson,
like his fellow fugitives, armed or active, yet he fled and
skulked.&nbsp; Manifestly Henderson had, in one way or other,
been suspiciously concerned in the affair.&nbsp; He had come in,
and was at Falkland, by August 20, when he was examined before
the Chancellor, Montrose, the King&rsquo;s Advocate, Sir Thomas
Hamilton, Sir George Hume of Spot (later Earl of Dunbar), and
others, in the King&rsquo;s absence.&nbsp; He deponed that, on
the night of August 4, Gowrie bade him and Andrew Ruthven ride
early to Falkland with the Master, and return, if the Master
ordered him so to do, with a message.&nbsp; At Falkland they went
into a house, <a name="citation64"></a><a href="#footnote64"
class="citation">[64]</a> and <!-- page 65--><a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>the Master
sent him to learn what the King was doing.&nbsp; He came back
with the news; the Master talked with the King, then told
Henderson to carry to Gowrie the tidings of the King&rsquo;s
visit, &lsquo;and that his Majesty would be quiet.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Henderson asked if he was to start at once.&nbsp; Ruthven told
him to wait till he spoke to the King again.&nbsp; They did
speak, at a gap in a wall, during the check in the run; Ruthven
returned to Henderson, sent him off, and Henderson reached Perth
about ten o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Gowrie, on his arrival, left the
company he was with (the two Hays), and here George Hay&rsquo;s
evidence makes Gowrie ask Henderson &lsquo;who was with the King
at Falkland?&rsquo;&nbsp; Hay said that Gowrie then took
Henderson into another room.&nbsp; Henderson says nothing about a
question as to the King&rsquo;s company, asked in presence of
Hay, a compromising and improbable question, if Gowrie wished to
conceal the visit to Falkland.</p>
<p>Apart, Gowrie put some other questions to Henderson as to how
the King received the Master.&nbsp; Henderson then went to his
house; an hour later Gowrie bade him put on his secret coat of
mail, and plate sleeves, as he had to arrest a Highlander.&nbsp;
Henderson did as commanded; at twelve the steward told him to
bring up dinner, as Craigengelt (the caterer) was ill.&nbsp;
Dinner began at half-past twelve; at the second course the Master
entered, Andrew Ruthven had arrived earlier.&nbsp; The company
rose from table, and Henderson, who was not at the moment in the
room, heard them moving, and <!-- page 66--><a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>thought that
they were &lsquo;going to make breeks for Maconilduy,&rsquo; that
is, to catch the Highlander.&nbsp; Finding he was wrong, he threw
his steel gauntlet into the pantry, and sent his boy to his house
with his steel cap.&nbsp; He then followed Gowrie to meet the
King, and, after he had fetched &lsquo;a drink&rsquo; (which
James says &lsquo;was long in coming&rsquo;), the Master bade him
ask Mr. Rhynd, Gowrie&rsquo;s old tutor, for the key of the
gallery, which Rhynd brought to the Master.&nbsp; Gowrie then
went up, and spoke with the Master, and, after some coming and
going, Henderson was sent to the Master in the gallery.&nbsp;
Thither Gowrie returned, and bade Henderson do whatever the
Master commanded.&nbsp; (The King says that Gowrie came and went
from the room, during his dinner.)&nbsp; The Master next bade
Henderson enter the turret, and locked him in.&nbsp; He passed
the time in terror and in prayer.</p>
<p>There follows the story of the entry of James and the Master,
and Henderson now avers that he &lsquo;threw&rsquo; the dagger
out of the Master&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; He declares that the Master
said that he wanted &lsquo;a promise from the King,&rsquo; on
what point Gowrie would explain.&nbsp; The rest is much as in the
King&rsquo;s account, but Henderson was &lsquo;pressing to have
opened the window,&rsquo; he says, when the Master entered for
the second time, with the garter to bind the King&rsquo;s
hands.&nbsp; During the struggle Henderson removed the
Master&rsquo;s hand from the King&rsquo;s mouth, and opened the
window.&nbsp; The Master said to him, &lsquo;Wilt thou <!-- page
67--><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>not
help?&nbsp; Woe betide thee, thou wilt make us all die.&rsquo; <a
name="citation67a"></a><a href="#footnote67a"
class="citation">[67a]</a></p>
<p>Henderson&rsquo;s later deposition, at the trial in November,
was mainly, but not without discrepancies, to the same effect as
his first.&nbsp; He said that he prayed, when alone in the
turret, but omits the statement (previously made by him) that he
deprived Ruthven of his dagger, a very improbable tale, told
falsely at first, no doubt, as Robertson the notary at first
invented his fable about meeting with Henderson, coming out of
the dark staircase.&nbsp; This myth Robertson narrated when
examined in September, but omitted it in the trial in
November.&nbsp; Henderson now explained about his first opening
the wrong window, but he sticks to it that he took the garter
from Ruthven, of which James says nothing.&nbsp; He vows that he
turned the key of the door on the staircase, so that Ramsay could
enter, whereas Ramsay averred that he himself forced the
door.&nbsp; Mr. Hudson (James&rsquo;s resident at the Court of
England), who in October 1600 interviewed both Henderson and the
King, says that, in fact, the Master had not locked the door, on
his re-entry. <a name="citation67b"></a><a href="#footnote67b"
class="citation">[67b]</a>&nbsp; Henderson slunk out when Ramsay
came in.&nbsp; He adds that it was <i>his</i> steel cap which was
put on Gowrie&rsquo;s head by a servant (there was plenty of
evidence that a steel cap was thus put on).</p>
<p><!-- page 68--><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
68</span>One singular point in Henderson&rsquo;s versions is
this: after Ruthven, in deference to James&rsquo;s harangue in
the turret, had taken off his hat, the King said, &lsquo;What is
it ye crave, man, if ye crave not my life?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;<i>Sir</i>, <i>it is but a promise</i>,&rsquo; answered
Ruthven.&nbsp; The King asked &lsquo;What promise?&rsquo; and
Ruthven said that his brother would explain.&nbsp; This tale
looks like a confusion made, by Henderson&rsquo;s memory, in a
passage in James&rsquo;s narrative.&nbsp; &lsquo;His Majesty
inquired what the Earl would do with him, since (if his
Majesty&rsquo;s life were safe, <i>according to promise</i>) they
could gain little in keeping such a prisoner.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Ruthven then, in James&rsquo;s narrative, said &lsquo;that the
Earl would tell his Majesty at his coming.&rsquo;&nbsp; It
appears that the word &lsquo;promise&rsquo; in the Royal version,
occurring at this point in the story, clung to Henderson&rsquo;s
memory, and so crept into his tale.&nbsp; Others have thought
that the Ruthvens wished to extort from James a promise about
certain money which he owed to Gowrie.&nbsp; But to extort a
promise, by secluding and threatening the King, would have been
highly treasonable and dangerous, nor need James have kept a
promise made under duress.</p>
<p>Perhaps few persons who are accustomed to weigh and test
evidence, who know the weaknesses of human memories, and the
illusions which impose themselves upon our recollections, will
lay great stress on the discrepancies between Henderson&rsquo;s
first deposition (in August), his second (in November), and the
statement of the King.&nbsp; In the footnote printed <!-- page
69--><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>below, <a name="citation69a"></a><a href="#footnote69a"
class="citation">[69a]</a> Hudson explains the origin of certain
differences between the King&rsquo;s narrative and
Henderson&rsquo;s evidence, given in August.&nbsp; Hudson
declares that James boasted of having taken the dagger out of
Ruthven&rsquo;s hands (which, in fact, James does not do, in his
published narration), and that Henderson claimed to have snatched
the dagger away, &lsquo;to move mercy by more merit.&rsquo;&nbsp;
It is clear that James would not accept his story of disarming
Ruthven; Henderson omits <i>that</i> in his second
deposition.&nbsp; For the rest, James, who was quite clever
enough to discover the discrepancies, let them stand, at the end
of his own printed narrative, with the calm remark, that if any
differences existed in the depositions, they must be taken as
&lsquo;uttered by the deponer in his own behouf, for obtaining of
his Majesty&rsquo;s princely grace and favour.&rsquo; <a
name="citation69b"></a><a href="#footnote69b"
class="citation">[69b]</a>&nbsp; Henderson&rsquo;s first
deposition was one of these which <!-- page 70--><a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>James printed
with his own narrative, and thus treated <i>en prince</i>.&nbsp;
He was not going to harmonise his evidence with
Henderson&rsquo;s, or Henderson&rsquo;s with his.&nbsp; On the
other hand, from the first, Henderson had probably the
opportunity to frame his confession on the Falkland letter of
August 5 to the Chancellor, and the Provost of Edinburgh; and,
later, on the printed narrative officially issued at the close of
August 1600.&nbsp; He varied, when he did vary, in hopes of
&lsquo;his Majesty&rsquo;s princely grace and favour,&rsquo; and
he naturally tried to make out that he was not a mere trembling
expostulating caitiff.&nbsp; He clung to the incident of the
garter which he snatched from the Master&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>Henderson had no Royal model for his account of how he came to
be in the turret, which James could only learn from
himself.&nbsp; Now that is the most incredible part of
Henderson&rsquo;s narrative.&nbsp; However secret the Ruthvens
may have desired to be, how could they trust everything to the
chance that the town councillor of Perth, upper footman, and
Chamberlain of Scone, would act the desperate part of seizing a
king, without training and without warning?</p>
<p>But <i>was</i> Henderson unwarned and uninstructed, or, did he
fail after ample instruction?&nbsp; That is the difficult point
raised by the very curious case of Mr. Robert Oliphant, which has
never been mentioned, I think, by the many minute students of
this bewildering affair.</p>
<h2><!-- page 71--><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
71</span>VI.&nbsp; THE STRANGE CASE OF MR. ROBERT OLIPHANT</h2>
<p>Suppose that men like the Ruthvens, great and potent nobles,
had secretly invited their retainer, Andrew Henderson, to take
the <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of the armed man in the turret, what could
Henderson have done?&nbsp; Such proposals as this were a danger
dreaded even by the most powerful.&nbsp; Thus, in March 1562,
James Hepburn, the wicked Earl of Bothwell, procured, through
John Knox, a reconciliation with his feudal enemy, Arran.&nbsp;
The brain of Arran was already, it seems, impaired.&nbsp; A few
days after the reconciliation he secretly consulted Knox on a
delicate point.&nbsp; Bothwell, he said, had imparted to him a
scheme whereby they should seize Queen Mary&rsquo;s person, and
murder her secretary, Lethington, and her half-brother, Lord
James Stuart, later Earl of Moray.&nbsp; Arran explained to Knox
that, if ever the plot came to light, he would be involved in the
crime of guilty concealment of foreknowledge of treason.&nbsp;
But, if he divulged the plan, Bothwell would challenge him to
trial by combat.&nbsp; Knox advised secrecy, but Arran, <!-- page
72--><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>now
far from sane, revealed the real or imagined conspiracy.</p>
<p>To a man like Henderson, the peril in simply listening to
treasonable proposals from the Ruthvens would be even
greater.&nbsp; If he merely declined to be a party, and kept
silence, or fled, he lost his employment as Gowrie&rsquo;s man,
and would be ruined.&nbsp; If the plot ever came to light, he
would be involved in guilty concealment of foreknowledge.&nbsp;
If he instantly revealed to the King what he knew, his word would
not be accepted against that of Gowrie: he would be tortured, to
get at the very truth, and probably would be hanged by way of
experiment, to see if he would adhere to his statement on the
scaffold&mdash;a fate from which Henderson, in fact, was only
saved by the King.</p>
<p>What then, if the Gowries offered to Henderson the
<i>r&ocirc;le</i> of the man in the turret, could Henderson
do?&nbsp; He could do what, according to James and to himself, he
did, he could tremble, expostulate, and assure the King of his
ignorance of the purpose for which he was locked up, &lsquo;like
a dog,&rsquo; in the little study.</p>
<p>That this may have been the real state of affairs is not
impossible.&nbsp; We have seen that Calderwood mentions a certain
Mr. Robert Oliphant (Mr. means Master of Arts) as having been
conjectured at, immediately after the tragedy, as the man in the
turret.&nbsp; He must therefore have been, and he was, a trusted
retainer of Gowrie.&nbsp; But Oliphant at once proved <!-- page
73--><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>an
alibi; he was not in Perth on August 5.&nbsp; His name never
occurs in the voluminous records of the proceedings.&nbsp; He is
not, like Henderson, among the persons who fled, and for whom
search was made, as far as the documents declare, though
Calderwood says that he was described as a &lsquo;black grim
man&rsquo; in &lsquo;the first proclamation.&rsquo;&nbsp; If so,
it looks ill for James, as Henderson was a brown fair man.&nbsp;
In any case, Oliphant at once cleared himself.</p>
<p>But we hear of him again, though historians have overlooked
the fact.&nbsp; Among the Acts of Caution of 1600&mdash;that is,
the records of men who become sureties for the good behaviour of
others&mdash;is an entry in the Privy Council Register for
December 5, 1600. <a name="citation73"></a><a href="#footnote73"
class="citation">[73]</a>&nbsp; &lsquo;Mr. Alexander Wilky in the
Canongate for John Wilky, tailor there, 200<i>l.</i>, not to harm
John Lyn, also tailor there; further, to answer when required
touching his (John Wilky&rsquo;s) pursuit of Lyn for revealing
certain speeches spoken to him by Mr. Robert Oliphant anent his
foreknowledge of the treasonable conspiracy of the late John,
sometime Earl of Gowrie.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Thus Robert Oliphant, M.A., had spoken to tailor Lyn, or so
Lyn had declared, about his own foreknowledge of the plot; Lyn
had blabbed; tailor Wilky had &lsquo;pursued&rsquo; or attacked
Lyn; and Alexander Wilky, who was bailie of the Canongate, enters
into recognisances to the amount of 200<i>l.</i> that John Wilky
shall not further molest Lyn.</p>
<p><!-- page 74--><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
74</span>Now what had Oliphant said?</p>
<p>On the very day, December 5, when Alexander Wilky became
surety for the good behaviour of John Wilky, Nicholson, the
English resident at Holyrood, described the facts to Robert
Cecil. <a name="citation74a"></a><a href="#footnote74a"
class="citation">[74a]</a>&nbsp; Nicholson says that, at a house
in the Canongate, Mr. Robert Oliphant was talking of the Gowrie
case.&nbsp; He was a man who had travelled, and he inveighed
against the unfairness of Scottish procedure in the case of
Cranstoun.</p>
<p>We have seen that Mr. Thomas Cranstoun, Gowrie&rsquo;s
equerry, first brought to Lennox and others, in the garden, the
report that the King had ridden away.&nbsp; We have seen that he
was deeply wounded by Ramsay just before or after Gowrie
fell.&nbsp; Unable to escape, he was taken, examined, tortured,
tried on August 22, and, on August 23, hanged at Perth.&nbsp; He
had invaded and wounded Herries, and Thomas Erskine, and had
encouraged the mob to beleaguer the back gate of Gowrie House,
against the King&rsquo;s escape.&nbsp; He had been in France, he
said, since 1589, had come home with Gowrie, but, he swore, had
not spoken six words with the Ruthvens during the last fortnight.
<a name="citation74b"></a><a href="#footnote74b"
class="citation">[74b]</a>&nbsp; This is odd, as he was their
Master Stabler, and as they, by their friends&rsquo; account, had
been making every preparation to leave for Dirleton, which
involved arrangements about their horses.</p>
<p><!-- page 75--><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
75</span>In any case, Mr. Robert Oliphant, in a house in the
Canongate, in November or early December 1600, declared that
Cranstoun, who, he said, knew nothing of the conspiracy, had been
hanged, while Henderson, <i>who was in the secret</i>, <i>and had
taken the turret part</i>, escaped, and retained his position as
Chamberlain of Scone.&nbsp; Henderson, at the critical moment,
had &lsquo;fainted,&rsquo; said Oliphant; that is, had failed
from want of courage.&nbsp; Oliphant went on to say that he
himself had been with Gowrie in Paris (February-March 1600), and
that, both in Paris and at home in Scotland later, Gowrie had
endeavoured to induce him to take the part later offered to
Henderson.&nbsp; He had tried, but in vain, to divert
Gowrie&rsquo;s mind from his dangerous project.&nbsp; This talk
of Oliphant&rsquo;s leaked out (through Lyn as we know), and
Oliphant, says Nicholson, &lsquo;fled again.&rsquo; <a
name="citation75"></a><a href="#footnote75"
class="citation">[75]</a></p>
<p>Of Oliphant we learn no more till about June <!-- page 76--><a
name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>1608.&nbsp;
At that time, the King, in England, heard a rumour that he had
been connected with the conspiracy.&nbsp; A Captain Patrick Heron
<a name="citation76"></a><a href="#footnote76"
class="citation">[76]</a> obtained a commission to find Oliphant,
and arrested him at Canterbury: he was making for Dover and for
France.&nbsp; Heron seized Oliphant&rsquo;s portable property,
&lsquo;eight angels, two half rose-nobles, one double pistolet,
two French crowns and a half, one Albertus angel; two English
crowns; one Turkish piece of gold, two gold rings, and a loose
stone belonging to one; three Netherland dollars; one piece of
four royals; two <i>quart decuria</i>; seven pieces of several
coins of silver; two purses, one sword; one trunk, one
&ldquo;mail,&rdquo; and two budgetts.&rsquo;&nbsp; Oliphant
himself lay for nine months in &lsquo;the Gate House of
Westminster,&rsquo; but Heron, &lsquo;careless to justify his
accusation, and discovering his aim in that business&rsquo;
(writes the King), &lsquo;presently departed from
hence.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;We have tried the innocency of Mr.
Robert Oliphant,&rsquo; James goes on, &lsquo;and have freed him
from prison.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Scottish Privy Council is therefore
ordered, on March 6, 1609, to make Heron restore Oliphant&rsquo;s
property.&nbsp; On May 16, 1609, Heron was brought before the
Privy Council in Edinburgh, and was bidden to make
restitution.&nbsp; He was placed in the Tolbooth, but released by
Lindsay, the keeper of the prison.&nbsp; In March 1610, Oliphant
having again gone abroad, Heron expressed his <!-- page 77--><a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>readiness to
restore the goods, except the trunk and bags, which he had given
to the English Privy Council, who restored them to Robert
Oliphant.&nbsp; The brother of Robert, Oliphant of Bauchiltoun,
represented him in his absence, and, in 1611, Robert got some
measure of restitution from Heron.</p>
<p>We know no more of Mr. Robert Oliphant. <a
name="citation77"></a><a href="#footnote77"
class="citation">[77]</a>&nbsp; His freedom of talk was amazing,
but perhaps he had been drinking when he told the story of his
connection with the plot.&nbsp; By 1608 nothing could be proved
against him in London: in 1600, had he not fled from Edinburgh in
December, something might have been extracted.&nbsp; We can only
say that his version of the case is less improbable than
Henderson&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Henderson&mdash;if approached by Gowrie,
as Oliphant is reported to have said that he
<i>was</i>&mdash;could not divulge the plot, could not, like
Oliphant, a gentleman, leave Perth, and desert his
employment.&nbsp; So perhaps he drifted into taking the
<i>r&ocirc;le</i> of the man in the turret.&nbsp; If so, he had
abundance of time to invent his most improbable story that he was
shut up there in ignorance of the purpose of his masters.</p>
<p>Henderson was not always of the lamblike demeanour which he
displayed in the turret.&nbsp; On March 5, 1601, Nicholson
reports that &lsquo;Sir Hugh Herries,&rsquo; the lame doctor,
&lsquo;and Henderson fell out and were at offering of
strokes,&rsquo; whence &lsquo;revelations&rsquo; <!-- page
78--><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>were
anticipated.&nbsp; They never came, and, for all that we know,
Herries may have taunted Henderson with Oliphant&rsquo;s version
of his conduct.&nbsp; He was pretty generally suspected of having
been in the conspiracy, and of having failed, from terror, and
then betrayed his masters, while pretending not to have known why
he was placed in the turret.</p>
<p>It is remarkable that Herries did not appear as a witness at
the trial in November.&nbsp; He was knighted and rewarded: every
one almost was rewarded out of Gowrie&rsquo;s escheats, or
forfeited property.&nbsp; But that was natural, whether James was
guilty or innocent; and we repeat that the rewards, present or in
prospect, did not produce witnesses ready to say that they saw
Henderson at Falkland, or in the tumult, or in the turret.&nbsp;
Why men so freely charged with murderous conspiracy and false
swearing were so dainty on these and other essential points, the
advocates of the theory of perjury may explain.&nbsp; How James
treated discrepancies in the evidence we have seen.&nbsp; His
account was the true account, he would not alter it, he would not
suppress the discrepancies of Henderson, except as to the
dagger.&nbsp; Witnesses might say this or that to secure the
King&rsquo;s princely favour.&nbsp; Let them say: the
King&rsquo;s account is true.&nbsp; This attitude is certainly
more dignified, and wiser, than the easy method of harmonising
all versions before publication.&nbsp; Meanwhile, if there were
discrepancies, they were held by sceptics to prove falsehood; if
there had been absolute harmony, that <!-- page 79--><a
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>would really
have proved collusion.&nbsp; On one point I suspect suppression
at the trial.&nbsp; Almost all versions aver that Ramsay, or
another, said to Gowrie, &lsquo;You have slain the King,&rsquo;
and that Gowrie (who certainly did not mean murder) then dropped
his points and was stabbed.&nbsp; Of this nothing is said, at the
trial, by any witnesses.</p>

80</span>VII.&nbsp; THE CONTEMPORARY RUTHVEN VINDICATION</h2>
<p>We now come to the evidence which is most fatally damaging to
the two unfortunate Ruthvens.&nbsp; It is the testimony of their
contemporary Vindication.&nbsp; Till a date very uncertain, a
tradition hung about Perth that some old gentlemen remembered
having seen a Vindication of the Ruthvens; written at the time of
the events. <a name="citation80"></a><a href="#footnote80"
class="citation">[80]</a>&nbsp; Antiquaries vainly asked each
other for copies of this valuable apology.&nbsp; Was it printed,
and suppressed by Royal order?&nbsp; Did it circulate only in
manuscript?</p>
<p>In 1812 a Mr. Panton published a vehement defence of the
Ruthvens.&nbsp; Speaking of the King&rsquo;s narrative, he says,
&lsquo;In a short time afterwards a reply, or counter manifesto,
setting forth the matter in its true light, written by some
friend of the Ruthven family, made its appearance.&nbsp; The
discovery of this performance would now be a valuable
acquisition; but there is no probability that any such exists, as
<!-- page 81--><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
81</span>the Government instantly ordered the publication to be
suppressed. . . . &rsquo;</p>
<p>The learned and accurate Lord Hailes, writing in the second
half of the eighteenth century (1757), says, &lsquo;It appears by
a letter of Sir John Carey, Governor&rsquo; (really Deputy
Governor) &lsquo;of Berwick, to Cecil, 4th September, 1600, that
some treatise had been published in Scotland, in vindication of
Gowrie.&rsquo;&nbsp; That &lsquo;treatise,&rsquo; or rather
newsletter, unsigned, and overlooked by our historians (as far as
my knowledge goes), is extant in the Record Office. <a
name="citation81"></a><a href="#footnote81"
class="citation">[81]</a>&nbsp; We can identify it as the
document mentioned by Carey to Cecil in his letter of September
4, 1600.&nbsp; Carey was then in command of Berwick, the great
English frontier fortress, for his chief, &lsquo;the brave Lord
Willoughby,&rsquo; was absent on sick leave.&nbsp; On September
4, then, from Berwick, Carey wrote to Sir Robert Cecil, &lsquo;I
have thought good to send you such&rsquo; (information) &lsquo;as
I have received out of Scotland this morning on both sides, both
on the King&rsquo;s part and the Earl&rsquo;s part, that you may
read them both together.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now we possess a manuscript, &lsquo;The Verie Maner of the
Erll of Gowrie and his brother their Death, quha war killit at
Perth, the fyft of August, by the Kingis Servanttis, his Majestie
being present.&rsquo;&nbsp; This paper is directed to &lsquo;My
Lord Governor,&rsquo; and, as Carey was acting for &lsquo;My Lord
Governor,&rsquo; Lord <!-- page 82--><a name="page82"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 82</span>Willoughby, at Berwick, he received
and forwarded the document to Cecil.&nbsp; This is the
Vindication, at least I know no other, and no printed copy,
though Nicholson writes that a &lsquo;book on the Ruthven side
was printed in England&rsquo; (October 28, 1600).</p>
<p>The manuscript is in bad condition, in parts illegible; acids
appear to have been applied to it.&nbsp; The story, however, from
the Gowrie side, can be easily made out.&nbsp; It alleges that,
&lsquo;on Saturday, August 1&rsquo; (really August 2), the lame
Dr Herries came, on some pretext, to Gowrie&rsquo;s house.&nbsp;
&lsquo;This man by my Lord was convoyed through the house, and
the secret parts shown him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now there was no &lsquo;secret part&rsquo; in the house, as
far as the narratives go.&nbsp; The entry to the narrow staircase
was inconspicuous, but was noticed by Ramsay, and, of course, was
familiar to Gowrie and his men.&nbsp; On Tuesday, the fatal day
(according to the Ruthven Vindication), Gowrie&rsquo;s retainers
were preparing to go with him &lsquo;to Lothian,&rsquo; that is
to Dirleton, a castle of his on the sea, hard by North
Berwick.&nbsp; The narrator argues, as all the friends of the
Ruthvens did, that, if Gowrie had intended any treason, his men
would not have been busy at their houses with preparations for an
instant removal.&nbsp; The value of this objection is null.&nbsp;
If Gowrie had a plot, it probably was to carry the King to
Dirleton with him, in disguise.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The Master, the apology goes on, whom the King had sent for
&lsquo;divers times before, and on August 5,&rsquo; <!-- page
83--><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>rode
early to Falkland, accompanied by Andrew Ruthven, and <i>Andrew
Henderson</i>.&nbsp; None of James&rsquo;s men, nor James
himself, as we have remarked, saw Henderson at Falkland, and
modern opponents of the King deny (as the aforesaid Mr. Panton
does) that he was there.&nbsp; Here they clash with &lsquo;The
Verie Manner&rsquo; &amp;c. issued at the time by Gowrie&rsquo;s
defenders.&nbsp; It avers that the Master, and his two men, did
not intend to return from Falkland to Perth.&nbsp; They meant to
sleep at Falkland on the night of the Fifth, and meet Gowrie,
next day, August 6, &lsquo;at the waterside,&rsquo; and cross
with him to the south coast of the Firth of Forth, thence riding
on (as other friendly accounts allege) to Dirleton, near North
Berwick.&nbsp; &lsquo;And Andrew Henderson&rsquo;s confessions
testified this.&rsquo;&nbsp; As published, they do nothing of the
sort.&nbsp; The Master &lsquo;took his lodging in Falkland for
this night.&rsquo;&nbsp; Hearing that James was to hunt, the
Master breakfasted, and went to look for him.&nbsp; After a
conversation with James, he bade Henderson ride back to Perth,
and tell Gowrie that, &lsquo;<i>for what occasion he knew
not</i>,&rsquo; the King was coming.&nbsp; Now after they all
arrived at Perth, the Master told Gowrie&rsquo;s caterer,
Craigengelt, that the King had come, &lsquo;because Robert
Abercrombie, that false knave, had brought the King there, to
make his Majesty take order for his debt.&rsquo; <a
name="citation83"></a><a href="#footnote83"
class="citation">[83]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; This fact was stated by
Craigengelt himself, <!-- page 84--><a name="page84"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 84</span>under examination.&nbsp; If Ruthven
spoke the truth, he did know the motive, or pretext, of the
King&rsquo;s coming, which the apologist denies.&nbsp; But
Ruthven was not speaking the truth; he told Craigengelt, as we
saw, that he had been &lsquo;on an errand not far off.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As to the debt, James owed Gowrie a large sum, with
accumulated interest, for expenses incurred by Gowrie&rsquo;s
father, when Lord Treasurer of Scotland (1583&ndash;1584).&nbsp;
James, in June 1600, as we shall see, gave Gowrie a year&rsquo;s
respite from the pursuit of his father&rsquo;s creditors, hoping
to pay him in the meanwhile.&nbsp; Whether this exemption would
not have defended Gowrie from Robert Abercromby; whether James
would act as debt collector for Robert Abercromby (a burgess of
Edinburgh, the King&rsquo;s saddler), the reader may
decide.&nbsp; But the Master gave to Craigengelt this reason for
James&rsquo;s unexpected arrival, though his contemporary
apologist says, as to James&rsquo;s motive for coming to Perth,
that the Master &lsquo;<i>knew nothing</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Henderson having cantered off with his message, James rode to
Perth (nothing is said by the apologist of the four hours spent
in hunting), &lsquo;accompanied by sixty horsemen, of whom thirty
came a little before him.&rsquo;&nbsp; No trace of either the
sixty or the thirty appears anywhere in the evidence.&nbsp; No
witness alludes to the arrival of any of the King&rsquo;s party
in front of him.&nbsp; On hearing from Henderson of the
King&rsquo;s approach, says the Vindication, Gowrie, who was
dining, ordered a new meal to be prepared.&nbsp; All <!-- page
85--><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>the
other evidence shows that Henderson came back to Perth long
before Gowrie dined, and that nevertheless Gowrie made no
preparations at all.&nbsp; Gowrie, with four others, then met the
King, on the Inch of Perth says the apologist.&nbsp; James kissed
him when they met, the kiss of Judas, we are to understand.&nbsp;
He entered the house, and all the keys were given to
James&rsquo;s retainers.&nbsp; The porter, as we saw, really had
the keys, and Gowrie opened the garden gate with one of
them.&nbsp; The apologist is mendacious.</p>
<p>Dinner was soon over.&nbsp; James sent the Master to bid
Ramsay and Erskine &lsquo;follow him to his chamber, where his
Majesty, Sir Thomas Erskine, John Ramsay, Dr. Herries, and Mr.
Wilson, being convened, slew the Master, and threw him down the
stair, how, and for what cause they [know best]
themselves.&rsquo;&nbsp; Of course it is absolutely certain that
the Master did not bring the other three men to James, in the
chamber where the Master was first wounded.&nbsp; Undeniably
Herries, Ramsay, and Erskine were not brought by the Master, at
James&rsquo;s command, to this room.&nbsp; They did not enter it
till after the cries of &lsquo;Treason&rsquo; were yelled by
James from the window of the turret.&nbsp; A servant of
James&rsquo;s, says the apologist, now brought the news that the
King had ridden away.&nbsp; Cranstoun, Gowrie&rsquo;s man, really
did this, as he admitted.&nbsp; Gowrie, the author goes on,
hearing of James&rsquo;s departure, called for his horse, and
went out into the street.&nbsp; There he stood &lsquo;abiding his
horse.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now Cranstoun, as he confessed, had told
Gowrie that his horse was <!-- page 86--><a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>at Scone, two
miles away.&nbsp; By keeping his horses there, Gowrie made it
impossible for him to accompany the Royal retinue as they went on
their useless errand (p. 21, <i>supra</i>).&nbsp; In the street
Gowrie &lsquo;hears his Majesty call on him out at the chamber
window, &ldquo;My Lord of Gowrie, traitors has murdered your
brother already, and ye suffer me to be murdered
also!&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Nobody else heard this, and, if Gowrie heard it, how inept it
was in him to go about asking &lsquo;What is the
matter?&rsquo;&nbsp; He was occupied thus while Lennox, Mar, and
the others were rushing up the great staircase to rescue the
King.&nbsp; James, according to the Ruthven apologist, had told
Gowrie what the matter was, his brother was slain, and slain by
Erskine, who, while the Earl asked &lsquo;What is the
matter?&rsquo; was trying to collar that distracted
nobleman.&nbsp; The Master had brought Erskine to the King, says
the apologist, Erskine had slain the Master, yet, simultaneously,
he tried to seize Gowrie in the street.&nbsp; Erskine was in two
places at once.&nbsp; The apology is indeed &lsquo;a valuable
acquisition.&rsquo;&nbsp; Gowrie and Cranstoun, and they alone,
the apologist avers, were now permitted by James&rsquo;s servants
to enter the house.&nbsp; We know that many of James&rsquo;s men
were really battering at the locked door, and we know that others
of Gowrie&rsquo;s people, besides Cranstoun, entered the house,
and were wounded in the scuffle.&nbsp; Cranstoun himself says
nothing of any opposition to their entry to the house, after
Gowrie drew his two swords.</p>
<p>Cranstoun, according to the apologist, first entered <!-- page
87--><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>the
chamber, alone, and was wounded, and drawn back by
Gowrie&mdash;which Cranstoun, in his own statement, denies.&nbsp;
After his wounds he fled, he says, seeing no more of
Gowrie.&nbsp; Then, according to the apologist, Gowrie himself at
last entered the chamber; the King&rsquo;s friends attacked him,
but he was too cunning of fence for them.&nbsp; They therefore
parleyed, and promised to let him see the King (who was in the
turret).&nbsp; Gowrie dropped his points, Ramsay stabbed him, he
died committing his soul to God, and declaring that he was a true
subject.</p>
<p>This narrative, we are told by its author, is partly derived
from the King&rsquo;s men, partly from the confessions of
Cranstoun, Craigengelt, and Baron (accused of having been in the
chamber-fight, and active in the tumult).&nbsp; All these three
were tried and hanged.&nbsp; The apologist adds that
James&rsquo;s companions will swear to whatever he pleases.&nbsp;
This was unjust; Ramsay would not venture to recognise the man of
whom he caught a glimpse in the turret, and nobody pretended to
have seen Henderson at Falkland, though the presence of Henderson
at Falkland and in the chamber was an essential point.&nbsp; But,
among the King&rsquo;s crew of perjurers, not a man swore to
either fact.</p>
<p>What follows relates to Gowrie&rsquo;s character; &lsquo;he
had paid all his father&rsquo;s debts,&rsquo; which most
assuredly he had not done.&nbsp; As to the causes of his taking
off, they are explained by the apologist, but belong to a later
part of the inquiry.</p>
<p><!-- page 88--><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
88</span>Such was the contemporary Vindication of Gowrie, sent to
Carey, at Berwick, for English reading, and forwarded by Carey to
Cecil.&nbsp; The narrative is manifestly false, on the points
which we have noted.&nbsp; It is ingeniously asserted by the
vindicator that <i>a servant of James</i> brought the report that
he had ridden away.&nbsp; It is not added that the false report
was really brought by Cranstoun, and twice confirmed by Gowrie,
once after he had gone to make inquiry upstairs.&nbsp; Again, the
apologist never even hints at the locked door of the gallery
chamber, whereat Mar, Lennox, and the rest so long and so vainly
battered.&nbsp; Who locked that door, and why?&nbsp; The subject
is entirely omitted by the apologist.&nbsp; On the other hand,
the apologist never alludes to the Murrays, who were in the
town.&nbsp; Other writers soon after the events, and in our own
day, allege that James had arranged his plot so as to coincide
with the presence of the Murrays in Perth.&nbsp; What they did to
serve him we have heard.&nbsp; John Murray was wounded by a
Ruthven partisan after the Earl and Master were dead.&nbsp; Some
Murrays jostled Gowrie, before he rushed to his death.&nbsp;
Young Tullibardine helped to pacify the populace.&nbsp; That is
all.&nbsp; Nothing more is attributed to the Murrays, and the
contemporary apologist did not try to make capital out of
them.</p>
<p>Though the narrative of the contemporary apologist for the
Ruthvens appears absolutely to lack evidence for its assertions,
it reveals, on analysis, a <!-- page 89--><a
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>consistent
theory of the King&rsquo;s plot.&nbsp; It may not be verifiable;
in fact it cannot be true, but there is a theory, a system, which
we do not find in most contemporary, or in more recent
arguments.&nbsp; James, by the theory, is intent on the
destruction of the Ruthvens.&nbsp; His plan was to bring the
Master to Falkland, and induce the world to believe that it was
the Master who brought <i>him</i> to Perth.&nbsp; The Master
refuses several invitations; at last, on his way to Dirleton, he
goes to Falkland, taking with him Andrew Ruthven and Andrew
Henderson.&nbsp; The old apologist asserts, what modern
vindicators deny, that Henderson was at Falkland.</p>
<p>Then the Master sends Henderson first, Andrew Ruthven later,
to warn Gowrie that, for some unknown reason, the King is
coming.&nbsp; To conceal his bloody project (though the apologist
does not mention the circumstance), James next passes four hours
in hunting.&nbsp; <i>To omit this certain fact is necessary for
the apologist&rsquo;s purpose</i>.&nbsp; The King sends thirty
horsemen in front of him, and follows with thirty more.&nbsp;
After dinner he leaves the hall with the Master, but sends him
back for Erskine, Wilson, and Ramsay.&nbsp; James having secured
their help, and next lured the Master into a turret, the minions
kill Ruthven and throw his body downstairs; one of them,
simultaneously, is in the street.&nbsp; James has previously
arranged that one of his servants shall give out that the King
has ridden away.&nbsp; This he does announce at the nick of time
(though Gowrie&rsquo;s <!-- page 90--><a name="page90"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 90</span>servant did it), so that Gowrie shall
go towards the stables (where he expects to find his horse,
though he knows it is at Scone), thus coming within earshot of
the turret window.&nbsp; Thence James shouts to Gowrie that
traitors are murdering him, and have murdered the Master.&nbsp;
Now this news would bring, not only Gowrie, but all the Royal
retinue, to his Majesty&rsquo;s assistance.&nbsp; But, as not
knowing the topography of the house, the retinue, James must have
calculated, will run up the main stairs, to rescue the
King.&nbsp; Their arrival would be inconvenient to the King (as
the nobles would find that James has only friends with him, not
traitors), so the King has had the door locked (we guess, though
we are not told this by the apologist) to keep out Lennox, Mar,
and the rest.&nbsp; Gowrie, however, has to be admitted, and
killed, and Gowrie, knowing the house, will come, the King
calculates, by the dark stair, and the unlocked door.&nbsp;
Therefore James&rsquo;s friends, in the street, will let him and
Cranstoun enter the house; these two alone, and no others with
them.&nbsp; They, knowing the narrow staircase, go up that way,
naturally.&nbsp; As naturally, Gowrie lets Cranstoun face the
danger of four hostile swords, alone.&nbsp; Waiting till
Cranstoun is disabled, Gowrie then confronts, alone, the same
murderous blades, is disarmed by a <i>ruse</i>, and is
murdered.</p>
<p>This explanation has a method, a system.&nbsp; Unfortunately
it is contradicted by all the evidence now to be obtained, from
whatever source it comes, retainers of Gowrie, companions of
James, or burgesses of <!-- page 91--><a name="page91"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 91</span>Perth.&nbsp; We must suppose that
Gowrie, with his small force of himself and Cranstoun, both
fencers from the foreign schools, would allow that force to be
cut off in detail, one by one.&nbsp; We must suppose that Erskine
was where he certainly was not, in two places at once, and that
Ramsay and Herries and he, unseen, left the hall and joined the
King, on a message brought by the Master, unmarked by any
witness.&nbsp; We must suppose that the King&rsquo;s witnesses,
who professed ignorance on essential points, perjured themselves
on others, in batches.&nbsp; But, if we grant that Mar, Lennox,
and the rest&mdash;gentlemen, servants, retainers and menials of
the Ruthvens, and citizens of Perth&mdash;were abandoned
perjurers on some points, while scrupulously honourable on others
equally essential, the narrative of the Ruthven apologist has a
method, a consistency, which we do not find in modern systems
unfavourable to the King.</p>
<p>For example, the modern theories easily show how James trapped
the Master.&nbsp; He had only to lure him into a room, and cry
&lsquo;Treason.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then, even if untutored in his part,
some hot-headed young man like Ramsay would stab Ruthven.&nbsp;
But to deal with Gowrie was a more difficult task.&nbsp; He would
be out in the open, surrounded by men like Lennox and Mar, great
nobles, and his near kinsmen.&nbsp; They would attest the
innocence of the Earl.&nbsp; They must therefore be separated
from him, lured away to attack the locked door, while Gowrie
would stand in the street asking &lsquo;What is the
matter?&rsquo; though <!-- page 92--><a name="page92"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 92</span>James had told him, and detained by
the Murrays till they saw fit to let him and Cranstoun go within
the gate, alone.&nbsp; Then, knowing the topography, Gowrie and
Cranstoun would necessarily make for the murder-chamber, by the
dark stair, and perish.&nbsp; The Royal wit never conceived a
subtler plot, it is much cleverer than that invented by Mr. G. P.
R. James, in his novel, &lsquo;Gowrie.&rsquo;&nbsp; Nothing is
wrong with the system of the apologist, except that the facts are
false, and the idea a trifle too subtle, while, instead of boldly
saying that the King had the gallery chamber locked against his
friends, the apologist never hints at that circumstance.</p>
<p>We have to help the contemporary vindicator out, by adding the
detail of the locked door (which he did not see how to account
for and therefore omitted), and by explaining that the King had
it locked himself, that Lennox, Mar, and the rest might not know
the real state of the case, and that Gowrie might be trapped
through taking the other way, by the narrow staircase.</p>
<p>An author so conspicuously mendacious as he who wrote the
Apology for English consumption is unworthy of belief on any
point.&nbsp; It does not follow that Henderson was really at
Falkland because the apologist says that he was.&nbsp; But it
would appear that this vindicator could not well deny the
circumstance, and that, to work it conveniently into his fable,
he had to omit the King&rsquo;s hunting, and to contradict the
Hays and Moncrieff by making Henderson <!-- page 93--><a
name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>arrive at
Perth after twelve instead of about ten o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>The value of the Apology, so long overlooked, is to show how
very poor a case was the best that the vindicator of the Ruthvens
was able to produce.&nbsp; But no doubt it was good enough for
people who wished to believe. <a name="citation93"></a><a

<h2><!-- page 94--><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
94</span>VIII.&nbsp; THE THEORY OF AN ACCIDENTAL BRAWL</h2>
<p>So far, the King&rsquo;s narrative is least out of keeping
with probability.</p>
<p>But had James been insulted, menaced, and driven to a personal
struggle, as he declared?&nbsp; Is the fact not that, finding
himself alone with Ruthven, and an armed man (or no armed man, if
you believe that none was there), James lost his nerve, and cried
&lsquo;Treason!&rsquo; in mere panic?&nbsp; The rest followed
from the hot blood of the three courtiers, and the story of James
was invented, after the deaths of the Gowries, to conceal the
truth, and to rob by forfeiture the family of Ruthven.&nbsp; But
James had certainly told Lennox the story of Ruthven and the pot
of gold, before they reached Perth.&nbsp; If he came with
innocent intent, he had not concocted that story as an excuse for
coming.</p>
<p>We really must be consistent.&nbsp; Mr. Barb&eacute;, a recent
Ruthven apologist, says that the theory of an accidental origin
of &lsquo;the struggle between James and Ruthven may possibly
contain a fairly accurate conjecture.&rsquo; <a
name="citation94"></a><a href="#footnote94"
class="citation">[94]</a>&nbsp; But Mr. Barb&eacute; also argues
that James had invented the pot of gold story before he left <!--
page 95--><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
95</span>Falkland; that, if James was guilty, &lsquo;the pretext
had been framed&rsquo;&mdash;the myth of the treasure had been
concocted&mdash;&lsquo;long before their meeting in Falkland, and
was held in readiness to use whenever circumstances
required.&rsquo;&nbsp; If so, then there is no room at all for
the opinion that the uproar in the turret was accidental, but Mr.
Barb&eacute;&rsquo;s meaning is that James thus forced a quarrel
on Ruthven.&nbsp; For there was no captive with a pot of gold,
nor can accident have caused the tragedy, if Ruthven lured James
to Falkland with the false tale of the golden hoard.&nbsp; That
tale, confided by James to Lennox on the ride to Perth, was
either an invention of the King&rsquo;s&mdash;in which case James
is the crafty conspirator whom Mr. Bruce, in 1602, did not
believe him to be (as shall be shown);&mdash;or it is true that
Ruthven brought James to Perth by the feigned story&mdash;in
which case Ruthven is a conspirator.&nbsp; I reject, for reasons
already given, the suggestion that Lennox perjured himself, when
he swore that James told him about Ruthven&rsquo;s narrative as
to the captive and his hoard.&nbsp; For these reasons alone,
there is no room for the hypothesis of accident: either James or
Ruthven was a deliberate traitor.&nbsp; If James invented the pot
of gold, he is the plotter: if Ruthven did, Ruthven is
guilty.&nbsp; There is no <i>via media</i>, no room for the
theory of accident.</p>
<p>The <i>via media</i>, the hypothesis of accident, was
suggested by Sir William Bowes, who wrote out his theory, in a
letter to Sir John Stanhope, from Bradley, on September 2,
1600.&nbsp; Bowes had been <!-- page 96--><a
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>English
ambassador in Scotland, probably with the usual commission to
side with the King&rsquo;s enemies, and especially (much as
Elizabeth loathed her own Puritans) with the party of the
Kirk.&nbsp; His coach had been used for the kidnapping of an
English gentleman then with James, while the Governor of Berwick
supplied a yacht, in case it seemed better to carry off the
victim by sea (1599).&nbsp; Consequently Bowes was unpopular, and
needed, and got, a guard of forty horsemen for his
protection.&nbsp; He was no friend, as may be imagined, of the
King.</p>
<p>Bowes had met Preston, whom James sent to Elizabeth with his
version of the Gowrie affair.&nbsp; Bowes&rsquo;s theory of it
all was this: James, the Master, &lsquo;and one other
attending&rsquo; (the man of the turret) were alone in a chamber
of Gowrie House.&nbsp; Speech arose about the late Earl of
Gowrie, Ruthven&rsquo;s father, whether by occasion of his
portrait on the wall, or otherwise.&nbsp; &lsquo;The King angrily
said he was a traitor, whereat the youth showing a grieved and
expostulatory countenance, and haplie Scotlike words, the King,
seeing himself alone and without weapon, cried
Treason!&rsquo;&nbsp; The Master placed his hand on James&rsquo;s
mouth, and knelt to deprecate his anger, but Ramsay stabbed him
as he knelt, and Gowrie was slain, Preston said, after Ramsay had
made him drop his guard by crying that the King was
murdered.&nbsp; The tale of the conspiracy was invented by James
to cover the true state of the case. <a name="citation96"></a><a
href="#footnote96" class="citation">[96]</a></p>
<p><!-- page 97--><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
97</span>This Bowes only puts forth as a working
hypothesis.&nbsp; It breaks down on the King&rsquo;s narrative to
Lennox about Ruthven&rsquo;s captive and hoard.&nbsp; It breaks
down on &lsquo;one other attending&rsquo;&mdash;the man in the
turret&mdash;whatever else he may have been, he was no harmless
attendant.&nbsp; It breaks down on the locked door between the
King, and Lennox and Mar, which Bowes omits.&nbsp; It is ruined
by Gowrie&rsquo;s repeated false assurances that the King had
ridden away, which Bowes ignores.</p>
<p>The third hypothesis, the <i>via media</i>, is
impossible.&nbsp; There was a deliberate plot on one side or the
other.&nbsp; To make the theory of Bowes quite clear, his letter
is appended to this section. <a name="citation97"></a><a

99</span>IX.&nbsp; CONTEMPORARY CLERICAL CRITICISM</h2>
<p>The most resolute sceptics as to the guilt of the Ruthvens
were the Edinburgh preachers.&nbsp; They were in constant
opposition to the King, and the young Gowrie was their favourite
nobleman.&nbsp; As to what occurred when the news of the tragedy
reached Edinburgh, early on July 6, we have the narrative of Mr.
Robert Bruce, then the leader of the Presbyterians.&nbsp; His own
version is printed in the first volume of the Bannatyne Club
Miscellany, and is embodied, with modifications, and without
acknowledgment (as references to such sources were usually
omitted at that period), in Calderwood&rsquo;s History.</p>
<p>It is thus better to follow Mr. Bruce&rsquo;s own account, as
far as it goes.</p>
<p>The preachers heard the &lsquo;bruit,&rsquo; or rumour of the
tragedy, by nine o&rsquo;clock on the morning of August 6.&nbsp;
By ten o&rsquo;clock arrived a letter from James to the Privy
Council: the preachers were called first &lsquo;before the
Council of the town,&rsquo; and the King&rsquo;s epistle was read
to them.&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>It bore that his Majesty was delivered
out of a peril</i>, and therefore that we should be commanded to
go to our Kirks, <!-- page 100--><a name="page100"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 100</span>convene our people, ring bells, and
give God praises.&rsquo;&nbsp; While the preachers were
answering, the <i>Privy</i> Council sent for the Provost and some
of the <i>Town</i> Council.</p>
<p>The preachers then went to deliberate in the East Kirk, and
decided &lsquo;that we could not enter into the particular
defence of&rsquo; (the existence of?) &lsquo;the treason, seeing
that the King was silent of the treason in his own letter, and
the reports of courtiers varied among themselves.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This is not easily intelligible.&nbsp; The letter from
Falkland of which Nicholson gives an account on August 6, was
exceedingly &lsquo;particular as to the treason.&rsquo;&nbsp; It
is my impression, based mainly on the Burgh Records quoted by
Pitcairn, that the letter with full particulars cited by
Nicholson, was written, more or less officially, by the notary,
David Moysie, who was at Falkland, and that the King&rsquo;s
letter was brief, only requiring thanksgiving to be
offered.&nbsp; Yet Nicholson says that the letter with details
(written by the King he seems to think), was meant for the
preachers as well as for the Privy Council (cf. p. 38, note).</p>
<p>The preachers, in any case, were now brought before the Privy
Council and desired, by Montrose, the Chancellor, to go to
church, and thank God for the King&rsquo;s &lsquo;miraculous
delivery from that vile treason.&rsquo;&nbsp; They replied that
&lsquo;they could not be certain of the treason,&rsquo; but would
speak of delivery &lsquo;from a great danger.&rsquo;&nbsp; Or
they would wait, and, when quite sure of the treason, would blaze
it abroad.</p>
<p><!-- page 101--><a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
101</span>&lsquo;They&rsquo; (the Council) &lsquo;said it should
be sufficient to read his Majesty&rsquo;s letter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This appears to mean that the preachers would content the
Lords by merely reading James&rsquo;s letter aloud to the
public.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We answered that we could not read his letter&rsquo;
(aloud to the people?) &lsquo;and doubt of the truth of it.&nbsp;
It would be better to say generally, &ldquo;if the <i>report</i>
be true.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>The preachers would have contented the Lords by merely reading
James&rsquo;s letter aloud to their congregations.&nbsp; But this
they declined to do; they wished, in the pulpit, to evade the
Royal <i>letter</i>, and merely to talk, conditionally, of the
possible truth of the <i>report</i>, or
&lsquo;bruit.&rsquo;&nbsp; This appears to have been a
<i>verbal</i> narrative brought by Graham of Balgonie, which
seemed to vary from the long letter probably penned by
Moysie.&nbsp; At this moment the Rev. David Lindsay, who had been
at Falkland, and had heard James&rsquo;s story from his own
mouth, arrived.&nbsp; He, therefore, was sent to tell the tale
publicly, at the Cross.&nbsp; The Council reported to James that
the six Edinburgh preachers &lsquo;would in no ways praise God
for his delivery.&rsquo;&nbsp; In fact, they would only do so in
general terms.</p>
<p>On August 12, James took the preachers to task.&nbsp; Bruce
explained that they could thank, and on Sunday had thanked God
for the King&rsquo;s delivery, but could go no further into
detail, &lsquo;in respect we had no certainty.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Had you not my letter?&rsquo; asked <!-- page 102--><a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>the
King.&nbsp; Bruce replied that the letter spoke only &lsquo;of a
danger in general.&rsquo;&nbsp; Yet the letter reported by
Nicholson was &lsquo;full and particular,&rsquo; but that letter
the preachers seem to have regarded as unofficial.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Could not my Council inform you of the particulars?&rsquo;
asked the King.&nbsp; The President (Fyvie, later Chancellor
Dunfermline) said that they had assured the preachers of the
certainty of the treason.&nbsp; On this Bruce replied that they
had only a report, brought orally by Balgonie, and a letter by
Moysie, an Edinburgh notary then at Falkland, and that these
testimonies &lsquo;fought so together that no man could have any
certainty.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Secretary (Elphinstone, later Lord
Balmerino) denied the discrepancies.</p>
<p>James now asked what was the preachers&rsquo; present
opinion?&nbsp; They had heard the King himself, the Council, and
Mar.&nbsp; Bruce replied that, as a minister, he was not fully
persuaded.&nbsp; Four of the preachers adhered to their
scepticism.&nbsp; Two, Hewat and Robertson, now professed
conviction.&nbsp; The other four were forbidden to preach, under
pain of death, and forbidden to come within ten miles of
Edinburgh.&nbsp; They offered terms, but these were
refused.&nbsp; The reason of James&rsquo;s ferocity was that the
devout regarded the preachers as the mouthpieces of God, and so,
if <i>they</i> doubted his word, the King&rsquo;s character
would, to the godly, seem no better than that of a mendacious
murderer.</p>
<p>From a modern point of view, the ministers, if doubtful, had a
perfect right to be silent, and <!-- page 103--><a
name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>one of
them, Hall, justly objected that he ought to wait for the verdict
in the civil trial of the dead Ruthvens.&nbsp; We shall meet this
Hall, and Hewatt (one of the two ministers who professed belief),
in very strange circumstances later (p. 217).&nbsp; Here it is
enough to have explained the King&rsquo;s motives for
severity.</p>
<p>In September the recalcitrants came before the King at
Stirling.&nbsp; All professed to be convinced (one, after
inquiries in Fife), except Bruce.&nbsp; We learn what happened
next from a letter of his to his wife.&nbsp; He had heard from
one who had been at Craigengelt&rsquo;s execution (August 23),
that Craigengelt had then confessed that Henderson had told him
how he was placed by Gowrie in the turret. <a
name="citation103"></a><a href="#footnote103"
class="citation">[103]</a>&nbsp; Bruce had sent to verify
this.&nbsp; Moreover he would believe, if Henderson were hanged,
and adhered to his deposition to the last: a pretty
experiment!&nbsp; The Comptroller asked, &lsquo;Will you believe
a condemned man better than the King and Council?&rsquo;&nbsp;
Mr. Bruce admitted that such was his theory of the Grammar of
Assent.&nbsp; &lsquo;If Henderson die penitently I will trust
him.&rsquo;&nbsp; Later, as we shall see, this pleasing
experiment was tried in another case, but, though the witness
died penitently, and clinging to his final deposition, not one of
the godly sceptics was convinced.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But Henderson saved the King&rsquo;s life,&rsquo;
replied the Comptroller to Mr. Bruce.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As to that I cannot tell,&rsquo; said Mr. Bruce, and
<!-- page 104--><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>added that, if Henderson took the dagger from Ruthven,
he deserved to die for not sheathing it in Ruthven&rsquo;s
breast.</p>
<p>Henderson later, we know, withdrew his talk of his seizure of
the dagger, which James had never admitted.&nbsp; James now said
that he knew not what became of the dagger.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Suppose,&rsquo; said the Comptroller, &lsquo;Henderson
goes back from that deposition?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then his testimony is the worse,&rsquo; said Mr.
Bruce.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then it were better to keep him alive,&rsquo; said the
Comptroller; but Mr. Bruce insisted that Henderson would serve
James best by dying penitently.&nbsp; James said that Bruce made
him out a murderer.&nbsp; &lsquo;If I would have taken their
lives, I had causes enough&rsquo; (his meaning is unknown),
&lsquo;I need not have hazarded myself so.&rsquo;&nbsp; By the
&lsquo;causes,&rsquo; can James have meant Gowrie&rsquo;s
attempts to entangle him in negotiations with the Pope? <a
name="citation104"></a><a href="#footnote104"
class="citation">[104]</a>&nbsp; These were alleged by Mr.
Galloway, in a sermon preached on August 11, in the open air,
before the King and the populace of Edinburgh (see <i>infra</i>,
p. 128).</p>
<p>Mar wondered that Bruce would not trust men who (like himself)
heard the King cry, and saw the hand at his throat.&nbsp; Mr.
Bruce said that Mar might believe, &lsquo;as he were there to
hear and see.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was left to inform himself, but Calderwood says, that the
story about Craigengelt&rsquo;s dying confession was
untrue.&nbsp; Bruce had frankly given the <!-- page 105--><a
name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>lie to the
King and Mar, though he remarked that he had never heard Mar and
Lennox tell the tale &lsquo;out of their own mouths.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Mar later (September 24) most solemnly assured Mr. Bruce by
letter, that the treason, &lsquo;in respect of that I saw,&rsquo;
was a certain fact.&nbsp; This he professed &lsquo;before God in
heaven.&rsquo;&nbsp; Meanwhile Mr. Hall was restored to his
Edinburgh pulpit, and Mr. Bruce, after a visit to
<i>Restalrig</i>, a place close to Edinburgh and Leith, went into
banishment. <a name="citation105a"></a><a href="#footnote105a"
class="citation">[105a]</a>&nbsp; If he stayed with the Laird of
Restalrig, he had, as will presently appear, a strange choice in
friends (pp. 148&ndash;167).</p>
<p>A later letter of Bruce&rsquo;s now takes up the tale.&nbsp;
In 1601, Bruce was in London, when Mar was there as James&rsquo;s
envoy.&nbsp; They met, and Bruce said he was content to abide by
the verdict in the Gowrie trial of November 1600.&nbsp; What he
boggled at, henceforward, was a public apology for his disbelief,
an acceptance, from the pulpit, of the King&rsquo;s veracity, as
to the events.&nbsp; In London, Bruce had found that the
Puritans, as to the guilt of Essex (which was flagrant), were in
the same position as himself, regarding the guilt of Gowrie. <a
name="citation105b"></a><a href="#footnote105b"
class="citation">[105b]</a>&nbsp; But they bowed to the law, and
so would he&mdash;&lsquo;for the present.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Puritans in England would not <i>preach</i> that they were
persuaded of the guilt of Essex, nor would Bruce preach his
persuasion of the guilt of Gowrie, &lsquo;from my knowledge and
from my persuasion.&rsquo;&nbsp; He <!-- page 106--><a
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>assured Mar
&lsquo;that it was not possible for any man to be fully
persuaded, or to take on their conscience, but so many as saw and
heard.&rsquo;&nbsp; However Bruce is self-contradictory.&nbsp; He
<i>would</i> be persuaded, if Henderson swung for it, adhering to
his statement.&nbsp; Such were Mr. Brace&rsquo;s theories of
evidence.&nbsp; He added that he was not fully persuaded that
there was any hell to go to, yet probably he scrupled not to
preach &lsquo;tidings of damnation.&rsquo;&nbsp; He wanted to be
more certain of Gowrie&rsquo;s guilt, than he was that there is
hell-fire.&nbsp; &lsquo;Spiteful taunts&rsquo; followed,
Mar&rsquo;s repartee to the argument about hell being
obvious.&nbsp; Bruce must have asserted the existence of hell,
from the pulpit: though not &lsquo;fully persuaded&rsquo; of
hell.&nbsp; So why not assert the King&rsquo;s innocence?</p>
<p>Bruce returned later to Scotland, and met the King in April
1602.&nbsp; Now, he said, according to Calderwood, that he was
&lsquo;resolved,&rsquo; that is, convinced.&nbsp; What convinced
him?&nbsp; Mar&rsquo;s oath.&nbsp; &lsquo;How could <i>he</i>
swear?&rsquo; asked James; &lsquo;he neither saw nor
heard&rsquo;&mdash;that is, what passed between James, the man in
the turret, and the Master.&nbsp; &lsquo;I cannot tell you how he
could swear, but indeed he swore very deeply,&rsquo; said Bruce,
and reported the oath, which must have been a fine example.&nbsp;
James took Bruce&rsquo;s preference of Mar&rsquo;s oath to his
own word very calmly.&nbsp; Bruce was troubled about the exact
state of affairs between James and the Master.&nbsp; &lsquo;Doubt
ye of that?&rsquo; said the King, &lsquo;then ye could not but
count me a murderer.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;It followeth not, if it
please you, Sir,&rsquo; <!-- page 107--><a
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>said Mr.
Robert, &lsquo;<i>for ye might have had some secret
cause</i>.&rsquo; <a name="citation107a"></a><a
href="#footnote107a" class="citation">[107a]</a></p>
<p>Strange ethics!&nbsp; A man may slay another, without
incurring the guilt of murder, if he has &lsquo;a secret
cause.&rsquo;&nbsp; Bruce probably referred to the tattle about a
love intrigue between Gowrie, or Ruthven, and the King&rsquo;s
wife.&nbsp; Even now, James kept his temper.&nbsp; He offered his
whole story to Bruce for cross-examination.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mr.
Robert uttered his doubt where he found occasion.&nbsp; The King
heard him gently, and with a constant countenance, which Mr.
Robert admired.&rsquo;&nbsp; But Mr. Robert would not
<i>preach</i> his belief: would not apologise from the
pulpit.&nbsp; &lsquo;I give it but a doubtsome trust,&rsquo; he
said.</p>
<p>Again, on June 24, 1602, James invited
cross-examination.&nbsp; Bruce asked how he could possibly know
the direction of his Majesty&rsquo;s intention when he ordered
Ramsay to strike the Master.&nbsp; &lsquo;I will give you leave
to pose me&rsquo; (interrogate me), said James. <a
name="citation107b"></a><a href="#footnote107b"
class="citation">[107b]</a></p>
<p>&lsquo;Had you a purpose to slay my Lord?&rsquo;&mdash;that
is, Gowrie.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As I shall answer to God, I knew not that my Lord was
slain, till I saw him in his last agony, and was very sorry, yea,
prayed in my heart for the same.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What say ye then concerning Mr. Alexander?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I grant I was art and part in Mr. Alexander&rsquo;s
slaughter, for it was in my own defence.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 108--><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
108</span>&lsquo;Why brought you not him to justice, seeing you
should have God before your eyes?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I had neither God nor the Devil, man, before my eyes,
but my own defence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here the King began to fret,&rsquo; and no
wonder.&nbsp; He frankly said that &lsquo;he was one time minded
to have spared Mr. Alexander, but being moved for the time, the
motion&rsquo; (passion) &lsquo;prevailed.&rsquo;&nbsp; He swore,
in answer to a question, that, in the morning, he loved the
Master &lsquo;as his brother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bruce was now convinced that James left Falkland innocent of
evil purpose, but, as he was in a passion and revengeful, while
struggling with the Master, &lsquo;he could not be innocent
before God.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here we leave Mr. Bruce.&nbsp; He signed a declaration of
belief in James&rsquo;s narrative; public apologies in the pulpit
he would not make.&nbsp; He was banished to Inverness, and was
often annoyed and &lsquo;put at,&rsquo; James reckoning him a
firebrand.</p>
<p>The result, on the showing of the severe and hostile
Calderwood, is that, in Bruce&rsquo;s opinion, in June 1602,
James was guiltless of a plot against the Ruthvens.&nbsp; The
King&rsquo;s crime was, not that strangely complicated project of
a double murder, to be inferred from the Ruthven apology, but
words spoken in the heat of blood.&nbsp; Betrayed, captured,
taunted, insulted, struggling with a subject whom he had treated
kindly, James cried to Ramsay &lsquo;Strike low!&rsquo;&nbsp; He
knew not the nature and extent of the conspiracy against him, he
knew not what knocking that was at <!-- page 109--><a
name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>the door of
the chamber, and he told Ramsay to strike; we have no assurance
that the wounds were deadly.</p>
<p>This is how the matter now appeared to Mr. Bruce.&nbsp; The
King swore very freely to the truth of his tale, and that
influenced Bruce, but the King&rsquo;s candour as to what passed
in his own mind, when he bade Ramsay strike Ruthven, is more
convincing, to a modern critic, than his oaths.&nbsp; For some
reason, Bruce&rsquo;s real point, that he was satisfied of the
King&rsquo;s innocence of a plot, but not satisfied as regards
his yielding to passion when attacked, is ignored by the
advocates of the Ruthvens.&nbsp; Mr. Barb&eacute; observes:
&lsquo;What slight success there ever was remained on
Bruce&rsquo;s side, for, in one conference, he drew from the King
the confession that he might have saved Ruthven&rsquo;s life, and
brought him to justice.&rsquo;&nbsp; That confession shows
unexpected candour in James, but does not in the slightest degree
implicate him in a conspiracy, and of a conspiracy even the rigid
Bruce now acquitted the King.&nbsp; Mr. Pitcairn, at first a
strong King&rsquo;s man, in an appendix to his third volume
credits Bruce with the best of the argument.&nbsp; This he does,
illogically, because the King never ceased to persecute Bruce,
whom he thought a firebrand.&nbsp; However wicked this conduct of
James may have been, it in no way affects the argument as to his
guilt in the conspiracy.&nbsp; Of <i>that</i> Mr. Bruce acquitted
the King.&nbsp; Calderwood&rsquo;s words (vi. 156) are &lsquo;Mr.
Robert, by reason of his oaths, thought him innocent of any
purpose that day in the <!-- page 110--><a
name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>morning to
slay them.&nbsp; Yet because he confessed he had not God or
justice before his eyes, but was in a heat and mind to revenge,
he could not be innocent before God, and had great cause to
repent, and to crave mercy for Christ&rsquo;s sake.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The thing is perfectly clear.&nbsp; Bruce acquitted James of the
infamous plot against the Ruthvens. <a name="citation110"></a><a
href="#footnote110" class="citation">[110]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; What,
then, was the position of the Ruthvens, if the King was not the
conspirator?&nbsp; Obviously they were guilty, whether James, at
a given moment, was carried away by passion or not.</p>
<h2><!-- page 111--><a name="page111"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 111</span>X.&nbsp; POPULAR CRITICISM OF THE
DAY</h2>
<p>Calderwood has preserved for us the objections taken by
sceptics to the King&rsquo;s narrative. <a
name="citation111"></a><a href="#footnote111"
class="citation">[111]</a>&nbsp; First, the improbability of a
<i>murderous</i> conspiracy, by youths so full of promise and
Presbyterianism as Gowrie and his brother.&nbsp; To
Gowrie&rsquo;s previous performances we return later.&nbsp; The
objection against a scheme of murder hardly applies to a plan for
kidnapping a King who was severe against the Kirk.</p>
<p>The story of the pot of gold, and the King&rsquo;s desire to
inspect it and the captive who bore it, personally, and the folly
of thinking that one pot of gold could suffice to disturb the
peace of the country, are next adversely criticised.&nbsp; We
have already replied to the criticism (p. 40).&nbsp; The story
was well adapted to entrap James VI.</p>
<p>The improbabilities of Ruthven&rsquo;s pleas for haste need
not detain us: the King did not think them probable.</p>
<p>Next it was asked &lsquo;Why did James go alone upstairs with
Ruthven?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He may have had wine enough to beget valour, or, as he said,
he may have believed that he was <!-- page 112--><a
name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>being
followed by Erskine.&nbsp; The two reasons may well have
combined.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why did not Gowrie provide better cheer, if
forewarned?&rsquo; (by Henderson?) it was asked.</p>
<p>To give the impression, we reply, that he was taken by
surprise, and that the King came uninvited and unexpected.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why did Ruthven aim a dagger at James, and then hold
parley?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Because he wanted to frighten the King into being &lsquo;at
his will.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How could Ruthven trust the King, with the armed man
alone in the turret?&rsquo;</p>
<p>What else could he do?&nbsp; He locked them in, and was,
through the failure of the man, in a quandary which made clear
reflection necessary&mdash;and impossible.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was strange that the man had not been trained in his
task.&rsquo;</p>
<p>If Oliphant is correctly reported, he had been trained, but
&lsquo;fainted.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why bind the King with a garter?&rsquo;</p>
<p>In helpless pursuit of the forlorn idea of capturing him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why execute the enterprise when the courtiers were
passing the window?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ruthven could not have known that they were coming at that
moment; it was Gowrie&rsquo;s ill-timed falsehoods, to the effect
that the King had ridden away, which brought them there.&nbsp;
Gowrie had not allowed for Henderson&rsquo;s failure.</p>
<p><!-- page 113--><a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>&lsquo;How could the King struggle successfully with
the stalwart Master?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He fought for his life, and Ruthven probably even then did not
wish to injure him bodily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why was not the Master made prisoner?&rsquo;</p>
<p>James answered this question when &lsquo;posed&rsquo; by Mr.
Bruce.&nbsp; His blood was up, and he said
&lsquo;Strike!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Earl likewise might, after he was stricken, have
been preserved alive.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps&mdash;by miracle; he died instantly.</p>
<p>The discrepancies as to the dagger and the opening of the
window we have already treated, also the locking and unlocking,
or leaving unlocked, of the chamber door, giving on the dark
staircase, after Ruthven&rsquo;s last hurried entrance (p.
69).</p>
<p>There follow arguments, to be later considered, about the
relations between James and the Earl previous to the tragedy, and
a statement, with no authority cited, that James had written to
Gowrie&rsquo;s uncle, to meet him at Perth on August 5, implying
that James had made up his mind to be there, and did not go on
Ruthven&rsquo;s sudden invitation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Earl and Cranstoun were alone with the four in the
fatal chamber.&nbsp; The others who were wounded there went up
after Gowrie&rsquo;s death.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It may be so, but the bulk of the evidence is on the other
side.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is reported&rsquo; that Henderson was eating an egg
in the kitchen, and went into the town when the fray arose.</p>
<p><!-- page 114--><a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>It is also denied, on oath, by Gowrie&rsquo;s cook, who
added that he was &lsquo;content to be hanged,&rsquo; if it could
be proved. <a name="citation114"></a><a href="#footnote114"
class="citation">[114]</a></p>
<p>The Ruthven apologist (MS.) says that Henderson was waiting on
the Lords who dined in the hall, and was <i>there</i> when <i>the
King&rsquo;s servant</i> brought the news that the King had
ridden away.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Master&rsquo;s sword, after his death, was found
rusted tight in his scabbard.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Master must have been a very untidy gallant.&nbsp; No
authority is cited for the story.</p>
<p>The Murrays (who were well rewarded) were in Perth,
&lsquo;whether of set purpose let the reader judge.&rsquo;</p>
<p>By all means let the reader judge.</p>
<p>The King knew Henderson (so the anonymous Goodman of Pitmillie
said), but did not recognise the man in the turret.&nbsp; It was
reported that Patrick Galloway, the king&rsquo;s chaplain,
induced Henderson to pretend to be the man in the turret.</p>
<p>As to the good man of Pitmillie, Calderwood did not even know
his name.&nbsp; This is mere gossip.</p>
<p>Again, Calderwood, who offers these criticisms, does not ask
why, of all concerned, Henderson was the only man that fled who
had not been seen in connection with the fray and the
tumult.&nbsp; If he was not the man of the turret, and if Andrew
Ruthven, who also had ridden to Falkland, did not abscond, why
did Henderson?</p>
<p><!-- page 115--><a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>As to the man in the turret, if not a retainer of
Ruthven, he was a minion of James, or there was no man at
all.&nbsp; If there was no man at all, could James be so absurd
as to invent him, on the off chance that somebody, anybody, would
turn up, and claim to have been the man?&nbsp; That is, frankly,
incredible.&nbsp; But if James managed to insert a man into the
turret, he was not so silly as not to have his man ready to
produce in evidence.&nbsp; Yet Henderson could not be produced,
he had fled, and certainly had not come in by August 12, when he
was proclaimed.</p>
<p>That James had introduced and suborned Henderson and that
Henderson fled to give tone and colour to his narrative, is not
among the most probable of conjectures.&nbsp; I do not find that
this desperate hypothesis was put forward at the time.&nbsp; It
could not be, for apologists averred (1) that Henderson was
eating an egg in the kitchen: (2) that he was waiting on the
gentlemen in the hall, at the moment when, by the desperate
hypothesis, he was, by some machination of James, in the turret:
(3) there is a third myth, a Perth tradition, that Henderson had
been at Scone all day, and first heard the tragic news, when all
was over, as, on his return, he crossed the bridge over
Tay.&nbsp; As it is incredible that there was no man in the
turret at all, and that James took the outside chance that
somebody, anybody, would claim to be the man; the assailants of
the King must offer a working hypothesis of this important actor
in the drama.&nbsp; My own fancy can suggest none.&nbsp; Was he
in four <!-- page 116--><a name="page116"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 116</span>places at once, in the kitchen, in
the hall, on the bridge, and in the turret?&nbsp; If he was in
the kitchen, in the hall, or on the bridge, why did he instantly
abscond?&nbsp; If <i>James</i> put him in the turret, why did he
fly?</p>
<p>The King&rsquo;s word, I repeat, was the word that no man
could rely on.&nbsp; But, among competing improbabilities, the
story which was written on the night of August 5, and to which he
adhered under Bruce&rsquo;s cross-examination, is infinitely the
least improbable.&nbsp; The Master of Gray, an abominable
character, not in Scotland when the events occurred, reported,
<i>not</i> from Scotland, that Lennox had said that, if put on
his oath, &lsquo;he could not say whether the practice proceeded
from Gowrie or the King.&rsquo;&nbsp; (Sept 30, 1600)</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>The Master of Gray wrote from Chillingham, on the English side
of the Border, where he was playing the spy for Cecil.&nbsp;
Often he played the double spy, for England and for Rome.&nbsp;
Lennox may well have been puzzled, he may have said so, but the
report rests on the evidence of one who did not hear his words,
who wished to flatter the scepticism of James&rsquo;s English
enemies, and whose character (though on one point he is unjustly
accused) reeks with infamy.</p>
<p>That of James does not precisely &lsquo;smell sweet and
blossom in the dust.&rsquo;&nbsp; But if the question arises,
whether a man of James&rsquo;s position, age, and temperament, or
whether a young man, with the antecedents <!-- page 117--><a
name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>which we
are about to describe, was the more likely to embark on a
complicated and dangerous plot&mdash;in James&rsquo;s case
involving two murders at inestimable personal risk&mdash;it is
not unnatural to think that the young man is the more likely to
&lsquo;have the wyte of it.&rsquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 118--><a name="page118"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 118</span>XI.&nbsp; THE KING AND THE
RUTHVENS</h2>
<p>Having criticised the contemporary criticism of the Gowrie
affair, we must look back, and examine the nature of
Gowrie&rsquo;s ancestral and personal relations with James before
the day of calamity.&nbsp; There were grounds enough for hatred
between the King and the Earl, whether such hatred existed or
not, in a kind of hereditary feud, and in political
differences.&nbsp; As against James&rsquo;s grandmother, Mary of
Guise, the grandfather of Gowrie, Lord Ruthven, had early joined
the Reformers, who opposed her in arms.&nbsp; Later, in 1566, it
was Gowrie&rsquo;s grandfather who took the leading part in the
murder of Riccio.&nbsp; He fled to England, and there died soon
after his exploit, beholding, it was said, a vision of
angels.&nbsp; His son, Gowrie&rsquo;s father (also one of the
Riccio murderers), when Mary was imprisoned in Loch Leven (June
1567) was in charge of her, but was removed, &lsquo;as he began
to show great favour to her, and gave her intelligence.&rsquo; <a
name="citation118"></a><a href="#footnote118"
class="citation">[118]</a>&nbsp; Mary herself, through the
narrative of Nau, her secretary, declares that Ruthven (then a
married <!-- page 119--><a name="page119"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 119</span>man) persecuted her by his
lust.&nbsp; He aided Lindsay in extorting her abdication at Loch
Leven.&nbsp; Such was his record as regards Mary: James too had
little reason to love him.</p>
<p>The early reign of James in Scotland was a series of Court
revolutions, all of the same sort.&nbsp; James was always either,
unwillingly, under nobles who were allies of Elizabeth, and who
used the Kirk as their instrument, or under vicious favourites
who delivered him from these influences.&nbsp; When Morton fell
in 1581, the King was under D&rsquo;Aubigny (Lennox), a false
Protestant and secret Catholic intriguer, and Arran (Captain
James Stewart), a free lance, and, in religion, an
Indifferent.&nbsp; Lennox entangled James in relations with the
Guises and Catholic Powers; Gowrie, and the Protestant nobles,
being threatened by Arran and Lennox, captured James, in an
insulting manner, at Gowrie&rsquo;s castle of Ruthven.&nbsp; He
came as a guest, for hunting; he remained a prisoner.&nbsp;
(1582.)&nbsp; The Kirk approved and triumphed: James waited and
dissembled, while Gowrie was at the head of the Government.&nbsp;
In June 1583, James, by a sudden flight to St. Andrews Castle,
where his friends surrounded him, shook himself free of Gowrie,
who, however, secured a pardon for his share in James&rsquo;s
capture, in the &lsquo;Raid of Ruthven&rsquo; of 1582.&nbsp;
Lennox being dead, the masterful and unscrupulous Arran now again
ruled the King, and a new Lennox came from France, the Duke of
Lennox who was present at the tragedy of August 5, 1600.</p>
<p><!-- page 120--><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
120</span>The Lords who had lost power by James&rsquo;s escape to
St. Andrews now conspired anew.&nbsp; Angus, Mar, and others were
to march on Stirling, Gowrie was waiting at Dundee. (April
1584)&nbsp; Arran knew of the plot, and sent Colonel Stewart to
arrest Gowrie.&nbsp; After holding his house against
Stewart&rsquo;s men, the Earl was taken and carried to
Edinburgh.&nbsp; The other Lords, his allies, failed and
fled.&nbsp; Gowrie was brought to trial.&nbsp; He had a pardon
for the Raid of Ruthven, he had done nothing ostensible in the
recent rising, which followed his capture at Dundee.&nbsp;
Nevertheless he was tried, condemned, executed, and
forfeited.&nbsp; There exists a manuscript of the date, which, at
least, shows what Gowrie&rsquo;s friends thought of the method by
which his conviction was procured.&nbsp; Arran and Sir Robert
Melville, it is said, visited him in prison, and advised him to
make his peace with James.&nbsp; How was that to be done?&nbsp;
Gowrie entreated for the kind offices of Melville and
Arran.&nbsp; They advised him to write to the King confessing
that he had been in several conspiracies against his person which
he could reveal in a private interview.&nbsp; &lsquo;I should
confess an untruth,&rsquo; said Gowrie, &lsquo;and frame my own
indictment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The letter, the others urged, being general, would move the
King&rsquo;s curiosity: he would grant an interview, at which
Gowrie might say that the letter was only an expedient to procure
a chance of stating his own case.</p>
<p>Gowrie, naturally, rejected so perilous a practice.</p>
<p><!-- page 121--><a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span>&lsquo;You <i>must</i> confess the foreknowledge of
these things,&rsquo; said Arran, &lsquo;or you must
die.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Gowrie replied that, if assured of his life, he would take the
advice.&nbsp; Arran gave his word of honour that Gowrie should be
safe.&nbsp; He wrote the letter, he received no answer, but was
sent to Stirling.&nbsp; He was tried, nothing was proved against
him, and Arran produced his letter before the Court.&nbsp; Gowrie
was called, confessed to his handwriting, and told the tale of
Arran&rsquo;s treachery, which he repeated to the people from the
scaffold.</p>
<p>This is, briefly, the statement of a newsletter to England,
written, as usual, against the Government, and in the Protestant
interest. <a name="citation121a"></a><a href="#footnote121a"
class="citation">[121a]</a>&nbsp; A manuscript in the British
Museum gives a somewhat different version. <a
name="citation121b"></a><a href="#footnote121b"
class="citation">[121b]</a>&nbsp; One charge against Gowrie, we
learn, was that of treasonable intercommuning with Hume of
Godscroft, an envoy of the Earl of Angus, who, before
Gowrie&rsquo;s arrest, was arranging a conspiracy.&nbsp; This
charge was perfectly true.&nbsp; Godscroft, in his History of the
Douglases (ii. 317&ndash;318), describes the circumstances, and
mentions the very gallery whose door resisted Lennox and Mar on
August 5, 1600.&nbsp; Godscroft rode from the Earl of Angus to
Gowrie in his house at Perth.&nbsp; &lsquo;Looking very pitifully
upon his gallery, where we were walking at that time, which he
had but newly built and decored with <!-- page 122--><a
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>pictures,
he brake out into these words, having first fetched a deep
sigh.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Cousin</i>&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;<i>is
there no remedy</i>?&nbsp; <i>Et impius haec tam culta novalia
miles habebit</i>?&nbsp; <i>Barbarus has
segetes</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp; Whereupon Godscroft was persuaded of
his sincerity, and at his return persuaded the Earl of Angus
thereof also.&rsquo;&nbsp; So the plot went on, Gowrie pretending
that he meant to leave the country, says his accomplice,
Godscroft, while both the Court and the conspirators were
uncertain as to his trimming intentions.&nbsp; He trimmed too
long; he was taken, the plot exploded and failed.&nbsp; Gowrie
was thus within the danger of the law, for treasonably concealing
foreknowledge of the conspiracy.</p>
<p>According to the British Museum MS., Gowrie now told the jury
that he was being accused on the strength of his own letter,
treacherously extorted under promise of life, by Montrose, Doune,
Maitland, Melville, Colonel Stewart, and the Captain of
Dumbarton, <i>not</i> by Arran.&nbsp; In Gowrie&rsquo;s letter of
confession, to the King, as printed by Spottiswoode, he does not
mention Godscroft, but another intriguer, Erskine.&nbsp; However,
in this letter he certainly confesses his concern with the
conspiracy.&nbsp; But, says the MS., the nobles charged by Gowrie
with having betrayed him under promise of life denied the
accusations on oath.&nbsp; Gowrie himself, according to another
copy of the MS., denied knowing Hume of Godscroft; if he did, he
spoke untruly, <i>teste</i> Godscroft.</p>
<p>However matters really stood, the Earl&rsquo;s friends, <!--
page 123--><a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
123</span>at all events, believed that he had been most cruelly
and shamefully betrayed to the death, and, as the King was now
eighteen, they would not hold him guiltless.</p>
<p>These were not the only wrongs of the Ruthvens.&nbsp; While
the power of Arran lasted (and it was, on the whole, welcome to
James, though he had moments of revolt), the family of Ruthven
was persecuted.&nbsp; The widow of Gowrie was a daughter (see
Appendix A) of Henry Stewart, Lord Methven, who, as a young man,
had married Margaret, sister of Henry VIII, widow of James IV,
and divorced from the Earl of Angus.&nbsp; As this lady, our
Gowrie&rsquo;s mother, knelt to implore the pity of James in the
street after her Lord&rsquo;s death, Arran pushed her aside, and
threw her down.&nbsp; He received the Earl&rsquo;s forfeited
estate and castle of Dirleton, near North Berwick.</p>
<p>In October 1585, Arran fell, in his turn; Angus, Mar, and
others drove him into retirement.&nbsp; James acquiesced; his
relations with the house of Mar remained most friendly.&nbsp; The
house of Ruthven was now restored to its lands and dignities, in
1586, the new Earl being James, who died in early youth.&nbsp; He
was succeeded by his brother, the Gowrie of our tragedy, who was
born about 1577.&nbsp; He had many sisters; the eldest, Mary,
married the Earl of Atholl, a Stewart, in January 1580.&nbsp;
Lady Gowrie was thus mother-in-law of the Earl of Atholl, who
died at Gowrie House in August 1594.&nbsp; Her grand-daughter,
<!-- page 124--><a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
124</span>Dorothea (daughter of Atholl and Mary Ruthven, sister
of our Gowrie), in 1604 married that young Tullibardine who was
in Perth at the tragedy of August 5, 1600.&nbsp; Lady Atholl is
said to have opposed the marriage.&nbsp; Another sister of
Gowrie, Sophia, married (before 1600, she was dead by that time)
the Duke of Lennox who was at the slaughter of the
Ruthvens.&nbsp; Another sister, Beatrix, was Maid of Honour to
James&rsquo;s Queen, and later married Hume of Cowdenknowes;
hence come the Earls of Home.&nbsp; Gowrie had two younger
brothers, Patrick and William, who fled to England from his
castle of Dirleton, the day after the tragedy, and were forfeited
and persecuted by James; Patrick was long imprisoned in the
Tower.</p>
<p>The new Earl, John, the victim of 1600, does not come into
public notice till 1592, when he was elected Provost of
Perth.&nbsp; He went to Edinburgh University; his governor was
the respected Mr. Rollock.&nbsp; Here a curious fact
occurs.&nbsp; On August 12, 1593, young Gowrie read his thesis
for his Master&rsquo;s degree.&nbsp; Three weeks earlier, on July
24, the wild Francis Stewart, Earl of Bothwell, had captured, in
Holyrood, his King, who was half dressed and untrussed.&nbsp;
James at the time was suspected of favouring the Catholic Earls
of the North, Huntly, Errol, and a new unpresbyterian
Angus.&nbsp; The King was on ill terms with the Kirk; England had
secretly abetted Bothwell; the clan of Stewart, including Lennox,
lent aid and countenance, <i>but Bothwell&rsquo;s </i><!-- page
125--><a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span><i>success was due to Gowrie&rsquo;s mother</i>, the
widow of the decapitated Earl, and to his sister, Lady
Atholl.&nbsp; Bothwell entered Lady Gowrie&rsquo;s house,
adjoining the palace, spent the night there, stole into Holyrood
by a passage-way left open by Lady Atholl, and appeared before
the King, sword in hand, when his Majesty was half dressed.&nbsp;
Meanwhile our Gowrie, reading for his thesis, may not have been
uninterested in the plot of his mother and sister.&nbsp; This
was, in a way, the second successful Ruthven plot to seize the
King; the first was the Raid of Ruthven.&nbsp; The new success
was not enduring.&nbsp; James shook off Bothwell in September
1593, and, in October, Gowrie&rsquo;s brother-in-law Atholl, with
our Gowrie himself, entered into alliance with Bothwell against
King James, and offered their services to Queen Elizabeth.</p>
<p>James moved out against Atholl, Gowrie, and the Master of
Montrose, who were at Castle Doune, intending to join hands with
Bothwell, and seize the King.&nbsp; But Bothwell found the plan
impracticable: Atholl fled; Gowrie and the Master of Montrose
were pursued and taken.&nbsp; No harm was done to them: their
excuses were accepted, but young Gowrie and Atholl continued to
conspire.&nbsp; In April, 1594, Atholl, signing for himself and
Gowrie, and Bothwell, signing for his associates, wrote a
manifesto to the Kirk.&nbsp; They were in arms, they said, for
Protestant purposes, and wished commissioners from among the
preachers to attend them, and watch their <!-- page 126--><a
name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
126</span>proceedings. <a name="citation126"></a><a
href="#footnote126" class="citation">[126]</a>&nbsp; Bothwell
then took action, he made a demonstration in arms against
Edinburgh, but the forces of Atholl and Gowrie did not arrive and
Bothwell retreated.&nbsp; Atholl was threatened for this affair,
but pardoned by the King, and died in August.</p>
<p>In the same month Gowrie informed the Town Council of Perth
that he was going to study abroad.&nbsp; They retained him in the
position of Provost.&nbsp; He went, with his tutor, Mr. Rhynd, to
Padua, an university where Protestantism was protected by the
toleration of the Republic of Venice, and where there was an
Anglo-Scottish &lsquo;Nation&rsquo; among the students.&nbsp; In
&lsquo;The Return from Parnassus,&rsquo; a satirical play of
1601, we find Gullio, the admirer of Shakespeare, professing to
have studied at Padua.&nbsp; Gowrie is said to have been elected
Rector, but I cannot find his name in the lists.&nbsp; He does
appear in the roll of Scottish scholars, some of them
characterised (unlike the English scholars) by personal
marks.&nbsp; Most have scars on the face or hand; Archibald
Douglas has a scar on the brow from left to right.&nbsp; James
Lindsay, of Gowrie&rsquo;s year (1596&ndash;1597), has also a
scar on his brow.&nbsp; Next him is Andrew Keith, with a scar on
his right hand, and then <i>Dominus Ioannes Ruthuen</i>,
<i>Scotus</i>, <i>cum signo albo in mento</i>, &lsquo;with a
white mark on his chin.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then we have his luckless
tutor, Mr. Rhynd, who was tortured, <i>Scotus cum ledigine super
facie</i>.&nbsp; Robert Ker of Newbattle (&lsquo;Kerrus de
Heubattel&rsquo;) is another of <!-- page 127--><a
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
127</span>Gowrie&rsquo;s college companions.&nbsp; All were
students of law.&nbsp; Magic was not compulsory at Padua, though
Gowrie was said to have studied that art. <a
name="citation127a"></a><a href="#footnote127a"
class="citation">[127a]</a></p>
<p>Concerning Gowrie&rsquo;s behaviour at Padua but a single
circumstance is known.&nbsp; Probably through one of his
fellow-students, Douglas, Ker, Keith, Lindsay or another, the
report reached Scotland that the young Earl had left in Padua
&lsquo;a strange relique,&rsquo; an emblematic figure emblazoned;
and had made, on the subject, a singular remark.&nbsp; The
emblematic figure represented &lsquo;a blackamoor reaching at a
crown with a sword, in a stretched posture:&rsquo; the remark of
Gowrie, &lsquo;the Earl&rsquo;s own <i>mot</i>,&rsquo; was to the
effect that the emblem displayed, <i>in umbra</i>, or
foreshadowed, what was to be done <i>in facto</i>.&nbsp; This
emblem was secured at Padua, in 1609, by Sir Robert Douglas, who
had heard of it in Scotland, and it was sent to King James. <a
name="citation127b"></a><a href="#footnote127b"
class="citation">[127b]</a>&nbsp; If such ideas were in
Gowrie&rsquo;s mind, he showed no signs of them in an early
correspondence with the King.&nbsp; In 1595, James wrote &lsquo;a
most loving letter&rsquo; to Gowrie; the Earl replied in a tone
of gratitude.&nbsp; At the same time Gowrie wrote to a preacher
in Perth, extolling the conduct of an English fanatic, who had
thrown down and trampled on the Host, at Rome.&nbsp; He hoped, he
said, when he returned to Scotland, &lsquo;to <!-- page 128--><a
name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>amend
whatever is amiss for lack of my presence.&rsquo; <a
name="citation128a"></a><a href="#footnote128a"
class="citation">[128a]</a>&nbsp; Nevertheless, on December 25,
1598, Nicholson informed Cecil that Gowrie had been converted to
Catholicism. <a name="citation128b"></a><a href="#footnote128b"
class="citation">[128b]</a>&nbsp; In the Venice despatches and
Vatican transcripts I find no corroboration.&nbsp; Gowrie appears
to have visited Rome; the Ruthven apologist declares that he was
there &lsquo;in danger for his religion.&rsquo;&nbsp; Galloway,
on August 11, 1600, in presence of the King and the people of
Edinburgh, vowed that Gowrie, since his return from Italy, had
laboured to make James &lsquo;revolt from Religion, at least in
inward sincerity, to entertain purpose with the Pope, and he
himself promised to furnish intelligence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>If so, Gowrie was, indeed, &lsquo;a deep dissimulate
hypocrite.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Galloway&rsquo;s informant must have been the King.&nbsp; If
Gowrie did or said anything to colour the story, it may have been
for the purpose of discovering, by pretending to approve of them,
these intrigues with Rome, of which James was constantly being
accused.</p>
<p>A new complexity is added here, by a list of Scottish Catholic
nobles, ready to join an invading <!-- page 129--><a
name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>Spanish
force, which the Earl of Bothwell handed in to Philip III. of
Spain, at a date not absolutely certain.&nbsp; At a time
conjectured at by Major Hume, as 1600, Bothwell laid before the
Spanish ministry a scheme for an invasion of Scotland.&nbsp; He
made another more elaborate proposal at a date which, to all
seeming, was July 1601.&nbsp; In the appended list of Scottish
Catholic nobles appear the names of the Earl of Gowrie, and of
&lsquo;Baron Rastellerse,&rsquo; that is, Logan of
Restalrig.&nbsp; But, in 1601, there was no Earl of Gowrie; the
title was extinct, the lands were forfeited, and Gowrie&rsquo;s
natural heir, William Ruthven, his brother, was a poor student at
Cambridge.&nbsp; Could Bothwell refer to him, who was no
Catholic?&nbsp; Can he have handed in (in 1601) an earlier list
of 1600, without deleting the name of the dead Gowrie?&nbsp; As
to Gowrie&rsquo;s real creed, Bothwell must have known the truth,
through Home, a reluctant convert to Presbyterianism, who went
from Paris to Brussels to meet Bothwell, leaving Gowrie in Paris,
just before Home and Gowrie openly, and, as it was said, Bothwell
secretly, returned to Scotland in April 1600.&nbsp; Was the
Gowrie conspiracy a Bothwellian plot? <a
name="citation129a"></a><a href="#footnote129a"
class="citation">[129a]</a></p>
<p>We know little more about Gowrie, after his letters of 1595,
till, on August 18, 1599, Colville reports to Cecil that the
party of the Kirk (who were now without a leader among the
greater nobles) intend to summon home the Earl. <a
name="citation129b"></a><a href="#footnote129b"
class="citation">[129b]</a>&nbsp; He is said to have <!-- page
130--><a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span>stayed for three months at Geneva with Beza, the famous
reformer, who was devoted to him.&nbsp; He was in Paris, in
February and March 1600.&nbsp; The English ambassador, Neville,
recommended Gowrie to Cecil, as &lsquo;a man of whom there may be
exceeding good use made.&rsquo;&nbsp; Elizabeth and Cecil were
then on the worst terms with James.&nbsp; At Paris, Gowrie would
meet Lord Home, who, as we have said and shall prove in a later
connection, had an interview with the exiled Bothwell, still
wandering, plotting and threatening descents on Scotland (p.
206).</p>
<p>On April 3, Gowrie was in London. <a
name="citation130a"></a><a href="#footnote130a"
class="citation">[130a]</a>&nbsp; He was very well received;
&lsquo;a cabinet of plate,&rsquo; it is said, was given to him by
Elizabeth; what else passed we do not know.&nbsp; In May Gowrie
returned to Scotland, and rode into Edinburgh among a cavalcade
of his friends.&nbsp; According to Sir John Carey, writing to
Cecil, from Berwick, on May 29, James displayed jealousy of
Gowrie, &lsquo;giving him many jests and pretty taunts,&rsquo; on
his reception by Elizabeth, and &lsquo;marvelling that the
ministers met him not.&rsquo; <a name="citation130b"></a><a
href="#footnote130b" class="citation">[130b]</a>&nbsp; Calderwood
adds a rumour that James, talking of Gowrie&rsquo;s entry to
Edinburgh, said, &lsquo;there were more with his father when he
went to the scaffold.&rsquo;&nbsp; Again, as the Earl leaned on
the King&rsquo;s chair at breakfast, James talked of dogs and
hawks, and made an allusion to the death of Riccio, in which
Gowrie&rsquo;s father and grandfather took part.</p>
<p>These are rumours; it is certain that the King <!-- page
131--><a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
131</span>(June 20) gave Gowrie a year&rsquo;s respite from
pursuit of his creditors, to whom he was in debt for moneys owed
to him by the Crown, expenditure by the late Earl of Gowrie when
in power (1583). <a name="citation131a"></a><a
href="#footnote131a" class="citation">[131a]</a>&nbsp; It is also
certain that Gowrie opposed the King&rsquo;s demands for money,
in a convention of June 21. <a name="citation131b"></a><a
href="#footnote131b" class="citation">[131b]</a>&nbsp; But so did
Lord President Fyvie, who never ceased to be James&rsquo;s
trusted minister, and later, Chancellor, under the title of Earl
of Dunfermline.&nbsp; Calderwood reports that, after
Gowrie&rsquo;s speech, Sir David Murray said, &lsquo;Yonder is an
unhappy man; they are but seeking occasion of his death, which
now he has given.&rsquo;&nbsp; This is absurd: Fyvie and the
Laird of Easter Wemyss opposed the King as stoutly, and no harm
followed to them; Fyvie rising steadily (and he had opposed the
King yet more sturdily before) to the highest official
position.</p>
<p>Calderwood adds a silly tale of Dr. Herries.&nbsp; Beatrix
Ruthven laughed at his lame leg; he looked in her palm, and
predicted a great disaster.&nbsp; The same anecdote, with, of
course, another subject, is told of Gowrie&rsquo;s own prediction
that a certain man would come to be hanged, which was
fulfilled.&nbsp; Gowrie had been at Perth, before the convention
at Holyrood of June 21.&nbsp; To Perth he returned; thence, some
time in July (about the 20th), <a name="citation131c"></a><a
href="#footnote131c" class="citation">[131c]</a> he went to his
castle of Strabran, <!-- page 132--><a name="page132"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 132</span>in Atholl, to hunt.&nbsp; Whether
his brother the Master remained with him continuously till the
Earl&rsquo;s return to Perth on Saturday, August 2, I know not
how to ascertain.&nbsp; If there is anything genuine in the
plot-letters produced eight years later, the Master once or twice
visited Edinburgh in July, but that may have been before going to
Strabran.</p>
<p>Concerning the Master, a romantic story of unknown source, but
certainly never alluded to in the surviving gossip of the day,
was published, late in the eighteenth century, by Lord
Hailes.&nbsp; &lsquo;A report is handed down that Lord
<i>Gowrie&rsquo;s</i> brother received from the Queen a ribbon
which she had got from the King, that <i>Mr. Alexander</i> went
into the King&rsquo;s garden at Falkland on a sultry hot day, and
lay down in a shade, and fell asleep.&nbsp; His breast being
open, the King passed that way and discovered part of the ribbon
about his neck below his cravat, upon which he made quick haste
into the palace, which was observed by one of the Queen&rsquo;s
ladies who passed the same way.&nbsp; She instantly took the
ribbon from his neck, went a near way to the Queen&rsquo;s
closet, where she found her Majesty at her toilet, whom she
requested to lay the ribbon in a drawer.&rsquo;&nbsp; James
entered, and asked to be shown the ribbon.&nbsp; The Queen
produced it, and James retired, muttering, &lsquo;Devil
tak&rsquo; me, but like is an ill mark.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Legend does not say when, or in what year this occurred.&nbsp;
But the fancy of authors has identified <!-- page 133--><a
name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>the
Queen&rsquo;s lady with Beatrix Ruthven, and has added that the
Master, in disgrace (though undetected), retired with Gowrie to
Strabane, or Strabran.&nbsp; History has no concern with such
fables.&nbsp; It is certain, however, or at least contemporary
letters aver, that Queen Anne of Denmark was grieved and angered
by the slaying of the Gowries.&nbsp; On October 21, 1600, Carey,
writing to Cecil from Woodrington, mentions this, and the tattle
to the effect that, as the Queen is about to have a child
(Charles I.), &lsquo;she shall be kept as prisoner ever
after.&rsquo;&nbsp; Was the Master supposed to be father of the
Queen&rsquo;s child?&nbsp; Carey goes on, &lsquo;There is a
letter found with a bracelet in it, sent from the Queen to the
Earl of Gowrie, to persuade him to leave his country life and
come to Court, assuring him that he should enjoy any contents
that Court could afford.&rsquo; <a name="citation133"></a><a
href="#footnote133" class="citation">[133]</a>&nbsp; Can some
amorous promise underlie this, as in the case of Mr.
Pickwick&rsquo;s letter to Mrs. Bardell, about the
warming-pan?&nbsp; &lsquo;This letter the King hath,&rsquo; says
Carey.&nbsp; Was it with Gowrie, not the Master, that the Queen
was in love?&nbsp; She was very fond of Beatrix Ruthven, and
would disbelieve in the guilt of her brothers; hence these tears
and that anger of the Queen.</p>
<p>But James also, says Calderwood, was as anxious as Carey
declares that the Queen was, to bring Gowrie to Falkland.&nbsp;
&lsquo;When the Earl was in Strabran, fifteen days before the
fact, the King wrote <!-- page 134--><a name="page134"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 134</span>sundry letters to the Earl, desiring
him to come and hunt with him in the wood of Falkland; which
letters were found in my Lord&rsquo;s pocket, at his death, as is
reported, but were destroyed.&rsquo; <a
name="citation134a"></a><a href="#footnote134a"
class="citation">[134a]</a></p>
<p>So James was not jealous; both he and the Queen were inviting
Gowrie to their country house, the Queen adding the gift of a
bracelet.&nbsp; She may have worked it herself, like the bracelet
which Queen Mary is said to have sent to Bothwell.</p>
<p>All this is the idlest gossip.&nbsp; But it is certain that,
on one occasion, at the end of July, &lsquo;close letters&rsquo;
were sent from the Court at Edinburgh to Atholl and Gowrie; and,
later, to Inchaffray and the Master, the first three are in
Bothwell&rsquo;s list of Catholics ready to meet the Spanish
invaders.&nbsp; The fact of the letters appears from the
Treasurer&rsquo;s accounts, where the money paid to the boy who
carried the letters is recorded, without dates of the days of the
month.&nbsp; The boy got 33 shillings, Scots, for the journey
from Edinburgh to the Earls of Gowrie and Atholl; 24 for the
other two, which he carried from Falkland.&nbsp; Craigengelt, in
his deposition, &lsquo;denies that during my Lord&rsquo;s being
in Strabran, neither yet in Perth, after his coming from
Strabran, he knew any man or page to come from Court to my Lord,
or that he commanded to give them any meat or drink.&rsquo; <a
name="citation134b"></a><a href="#footnote134b"
class="citation">[134b]</a></p>
<p><!-- page 135--><a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
135</span>No conclusion as to James&rsquo;s guilt can be drawn,
either from the fact that he wrote to Atholl, Inchaffray, the
Master, and Gowrie at the end of July, or from the circumstance
that Craigengelt professed to know nothing about any
messenger.&nbsp; James might write to ask the Earl to hunt, we
cannot guess what he had to say, at the same time, to Atholl or
Inchaffray or the Master.&nbsp; He may even have written about
the affair of the Abbey of Scone, if it is true that the Master
wished to get it from his brother.&nbsp; We really cannot infer
that, as the Ruthvens would not come and be killed, when invited,
at Falkland, James went to kill them at Perth.&nbsp; Even if he
summoned the Master for August 5, intending to make it appear
that the Master had asked him to come to Perth, the Master need
not have arrived before seven in the morning, when the King went
and hunted for four hours.&nbsp; What conceivable reason had the
Master, if innocent, for leaving Perth <!-- page 136--><a
name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>at 4 <span
class="smcap">a.m.</span> and visiting his sovereign at seven in
the morning?</p>
<p>As to the coming of the Gowries to Perth from Strabran or
Strabane before the tragedy, we only know what Craigengelt
stated.&nbsp; His language is not lucid.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Depones that, my Lords being in Strabrand, Alexander
Ruthven&rsquo; (a kinsman) &lsquo;came from Dunkeld to my
Lord.&nbsp; And that upon Friday (August 1) my Lord commanded
Captain Ruthven to ride, and tell my Lady&rsquo; (Gowrie&rsquo;s
mother), &lsquo;that he was to come, and Captain Ruthven met my
Lord at the ferry-boat, and rode back to Dunkeld with my Lord,
where he&rsquo; (Gowrie) &lsquo;having supped, returned to his
bed at Trochene, the deponer being in his company.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Where, at the end of July, was Lady Gowrie?&nbsp; Was she
within a day&rsquo;s ride of her sons?&nbsp; Was she at
Perth?&nbsp; We know that she was at Dirleton Castle, near North
Berwick, on August 6.&nbsp; Had she left the neighbourhood of
Perth between the 1st and 5th of August?&nbsp; Captain Ruthven
seems to have ridden to Lady Gowrie, and back again to Dunkeld
with Gowrie.&nbsp; If so (and I can make no other sense of it),
she was in Perthshire on August 1, and went at once to
Dirleton.&nbsp; Did she keep out of the way of the performances
of August 5?</p>
<p>It is curious that no apologist for Gowrie, as far as I have
observed, makes any remark on this perplexing affair of &lsquo;my
Lady.&rsquo;&nbsp; We know that she had <!-- page 137--><a
name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>once
already set a successful trap for the King.&nbsp; He had not
punished her; he took two of her daughters, Barbara and Beatrix,
into his household; and restored to Gowrie his inheritance of the
lands of Scone, which, as we know, had been held by his
father.&nbsp; He had written a loving letter to Gowrie at Padua,
after the young man had for many months been conspiring against
him with his most dangerous enemy, the wild Earl of Bothwell.</p>
<p>On the morning of the fatal August 5, Gowrie went to
sermon.&nbsp; What else he did, we learn from John Moncrieff, who
was the Earl&rsquo;s cautioner, or guarantee, for a large sum due
by him to one Robert Jolly. <a name="citation137"></a><a
href="#footnote137" class="citation">[137]</a>&nbsp; He was also
brother of Hew Moncrieff, who fled after having been with Gowrie
in arms, against Herries, Ramsay, and Erskine.&nbsp; Both
Moncrieffs, says John, were puzzled when they found that the
Master had ridden from Perth so early in the morning.&nbsp;
Gowrie, says Moncrieff, did not attend the Town Council meeting
after church; he excused himself on account of private
affairs.&nbsp; He also sent away George Hay who was with him on
business when Henderson arrived from Falkland, saying that he had
other engagements.&nbsp; For the same reason, he, at first,
declined to do a piece of business with Moncrieff, who dined with
him and two other gentlemen.&nbsp; &lsquo;He made him to misknow
all things,&rsquo; that is affected to take no notice, when
Andrew Ruthven came in, and &lsquo;rounded to him&rsquo;
(whispered to him) about the <!-- page 138--><a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
138</span>King&rsquo;s approach.&nbsp; Then the Master entered,
and Gowrie went out to meet the King.</p>
<p>The rest we know, as far as evidence exists.</p>

</a></p>
<p>We now have all the essential facts which rest on fairly good
evidence, and we ask, did the Ruthvens lay a plot for the King,
or did the King weave a web to catch the Ruthvens?&nbsp; Looking
first at character and probable motives, we dismiss the gossip
about the amorous Queen and the jealous King.&nbsp; The tatlers
did not know whether to select Gowrie or the Master as the object
of the Queen&rsquo;s passion, or whether to allege that she had a
polyandrous affection for both at once.&nbsp; The letters of the
age hint at no such amour till after the tragedy, when tales of
the <i>liaison</i> of Anne of Denmark with the elder or younger
Ruthven, or both, arose as a myth to account for the
events.&nbsp; The Queen, no doubt, was deeply grieved in a
womanly way for the sake of her two maidens, Beatrix and Barbara
Ruthven.&nbsp; Her Majesty, also in a womanly way, had a running
feud with Mar and the whole house of Erskine.&nbsp; To Mar,
certainly one of the few men of honour as well as of rank in
Scotland, James had entrusted his son, Prince Henry; the care of
the heir to the Crown was a kind of hereditary charge of the
Erskines.&nbsp; The Queen had already, in her resentment at not
having the custody of her son, engaged in one dangerous plot
against Mar; she made another quarrel on this point at the time
(1603) when the King succeeded to the crown of England.&nbsp; Now
Mar was present at the <!-- page 139--><a
name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>Gowrie
tragedy, and his cousin, Sir Thomas Erskine, took part in the
deeds.&nbsp; Hating the Erskines, devoted to the Ruthven ladies,
and always feebly in opposition to her husband, the Queen, no
doubt, paraded her grief, her scepticism, and her
resentment.&nbsp; This was quite in keeping with her character,
and this conduct lent colour to the myth that she loved Gowrie,
or the Master, or both, <i>par amours</i>.&nbsp; The subject is
good for a ballad or a novel, but history has nothing to make
with the legend on which Mr. G. P. R. James based a romance, and
Mr. Pinkerton a theory.</p>
<p>Leaving fable for fact, what motives had James for killing
both the Ruthvens?&nbsp; He had dropped the hereditary feud, and
had taken no measures against the young Earl to punish his
conspiracies with Bothwell in 1593&ndash;1594.&nbsp; Of Gowrie,
on his return to Scotland in May, he may have entertained some
jealousy.&nbsp; The Earl had been for months in Paris, caressed
by the English ambassador, and probably, as we have seen, in
touch with the exiled and ceaselessly conspiring Bothwell.&nbsp;
In London the Earl had been well received by Elizabeth, and by
Lord Willoughby, who, a year earlier, as Governor of Berwick, had
insulted James by kidnapping, close to Edinburgh, an English
gentleman, Ashfield, on a visit to the King&rsquo;s Court.&nbsp;
Guevara, a cousin of Lord Willoughby, lured Ashfield into the
coach of the English envoy Bowes, and drove him to the
frontier.&nbsp; Lord Willoughby had a swift yacht lying off
Leith, in case it was thought better to abduct Ashfield by
sea.&nbsp; This is <!-- page 140--><a name="page140"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 140</span>an example of English insolence to
the Scottish King&mdash;also of English kidnapping&mdash;and Lord
Willoughby, the manager, had made friends with Gowrie in
England.</p>
<p>Thus James, who was then on the worst terms, short of open
war, with England, may have suspected and disliked the Earl, who
had once already put himself at the service of Elizabeth, and
might do so again.&nbsp; In the April of 1600, rumours of a
conspiracy by Archibald Douglas, the infamous traitor; Douglas of
Spot, one of Morton&rsquo;s brood, and John Colville&mdash;who,
with Bothwell and, later, independently, had caught James, had
tried to catch him, and proposed to Essex to catch him
again,&mdash;were afloat.&nbsp; Colville was in Paris at the same
time as Gowrie; Bothwell was reported to have come secretly to
Scotland in April or May, and this combination of facts or
rumours may have aroused the King&rsquo;s mistrust.&nbsp; Again,
the Kirk was restive; the preachers, in need of a leader, were
said by Colville to have summoned Gowrie home. <a
name="citation140a"></a><a href="#footnote140a"
class="citation">[140a]</a>&nbsp; Moreover there were persons
about James&mdash;for example, Colonel Stewart&mdash;who had
reason to dread the Earl&rsquo;s vengeance for his father.&nbsp;
The Ruthven Apologist mentions this fact, and the predilection of
the Kirk for Gowrie, among the motives for destroying him.</p>
<p>Once more there are hints, very vague, that, in 1593, Bothwell
aimed at changing the dynasty. <a name="citation140b"></a><a
href="#footnote140b" class="citation">[140b]</a>&nbsp; The fable
that Gowrie was a maternal grandson of Margaret Tudor, widow of
James IV, by Henry Stewart, <!-- page 141--><a
name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>Lord
Methven, her third husband, and that Gowrie was thus a candidate
for the succession to the English throne, perhaps also for the
hand of Arabella Stuart, may conceivably have existed.&nbsp;
(Compare Appendix A.)&nbsp; Again, Gowrie had sided with the
burgesses and minor barons, as against the nobles, by refusing a
grant of money to James, in the convention of June 1600, and
James owed money to Gowrie, as he did to most people.&nbsp; But
we have already seen that an exemption had been granted to Gowrie
for a year from pursuit of creditors, as far, that is, as
regarded his <i>father&rsquo;s</i> debts (80,000<i>l.</i> Scots),
(June 20, 1600).&nbsp; The College of Justice refused to grant
any new legal summonses of creditors against Gowrie, and
suspended all that were extant.</p>
<p>Mr. Barb&eacute; accuses the King of &lsquo;utter and
unblushing disregard for common truth and common
honesty.&rsquo;&nbsp; Be this as it may, the exemption granted to
Gowrie was not regarded by his father&rsquo;s creditors as
extending to his mother, after his dishonoured death.&nbsp; On
November 1, 1600, Lady Gowrie implored Elphinstone, the
Secretary, to bring her suit for relief before the King.&nbsp;
The security for these debts was on her &lsquo;conjunct fee
lands,&rsquo; and creditors, because, I suppose, the Gowrie
estates were about to be forfeited, pressed Lady Gowrie, who, of
course, had no exemption.&nbsp; We know nothing as to the success
of Lady Gowrie&rsquo;s petition, but we have seen that her
daughters married very well.&nbsp; I presume that Gowrie, not his
mother, had previously <!-- page 142--><a
name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>paid
interest on the debts, &lsquo;he had already paid many sums of
money.&rsquo;&nbsp; James had already restored to Gowrie the
valuable lands of Scone. <a name="citation142"></a><a
href="#footnote142" class="citation">[142]</a></p>
<p>However, taking things as the King&rsquo;s adversaries regard
them, the cumulative effect of these several grudges (and of the
mystery of Gowrie&rsquo;s Catholicism) would urge James to lay
his very subtle plot.&nbsp; He would secretly call young Ruthven
to Falkland by six in the morning of August 5, he would make it
appear that Ruthven had invited <i>him</i> to Perth, he would
lure the youth to a turret, managing to be locked in with him and
an armed man; he would post Ramsay below the turret window, and
warn him to run up the dark staircase at the King&rsquo;s cry of
treason.&nbsp; By the locked door he would exclude Lennox and
Mar, while his minions would first delay Gowrie&rsquo;s approach,
by the narrow stairs, and then permit him to enter with only one
companion, Cranstoun.&nbsp; He would cause a report of his own
departure to be circulated, exactly at the right moment to bring
Gowrie under the turret window, and within reach of his
cries.&nbsp; This plot requires the minutest punctuality,
everything must occur at the right moment, and all would have
been defeated had Gowrie told the truth about the King&rsquo;s
departure, or even asked &lsquo;Where is the King&rsquo;s
horse?&rsquo;&nbsp; Or Gowrie might have stood in the streets of
Perth, and summoned his burgesses in arms.&nbsp; The King and the
courtiers, with their dead man, would have been <!-- page
143--><a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
143</span>beleaguered, without provisions, in Gowrie&rsquo;s
house.&nbsp; Was James the man, on the strength of the grudges
which we have carefully enumerated, to risk himself, unarmed, in
this situation?&nbsp; As to how he managed to have the door
locked, so as to exclude the majority of his suite, who can
conjecture?&nbsp; How, again, did he induce Gowrie to aver, and
that after making inquiry, that he <i>had</i> ridden
homewards?</p>
<p>I cannot believe that any sane man or monarch, from the
motives specified, would or could have laid, and that
successfully, the plot attributed to the King.</p>
<p>Turning to Gowrie, we find that his grudges against James may
have been deep and many.&nbsp; If revengeful, he had the
treacherous method of his father&rsquo;s conviction, and the
insults to his mother, to punish.&nbsp; For a boy of seventeen he
had already attempted a good deal, in 1593&ndash;1594.&nbsp; His
mother had set him an example of King-catching, and it looks as
if his mother had been near him in Perth, while he was at
Strabane.&nbsp; If ambitious, and devoted to Elizabeth and
England (as he had been), Gowrie had motives for a new Raid of
Ruthven, the unceasing desire of the English Government.&nbsp; He
might, if successful, head a new administration resting on the
support of England and the Kirk.&nbsp; Such a change was due in
the natural course of things.&nbsp; Or, quite the reverse, if a
secret Catholic he might hand the King over to Bothwell.</p>
<p>Thus Gowrie may well have wished to revenge his father; his
mother had once already helped to <!-- page 144--><a
name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>betray
James to an attack of the most insulting nature; he himself was
strong for the Kirk, over which James was playing the despot;
<i>or</i>, he desired toleration for Catholics; he had been well
received in England, where all such plots&mdash;their name was
legion&mdash;had always been fostered; he was very young, and he
risked everything.&nbsp; Only his method was new&mdash;that of
strict secrecy.&nbsp; He had previously spoken to Mr. Cowper,
minister of Perth, in a general way, about the failure of plots
for lack of deep secrecy, and through the admission of too many
confederates.&nbsp; Cowper told this to Spottiswoode, at
Falkland.&nbsp; Mr. Rhynd, Gowrie&rsquo;s tutor, told Cowper and
the Comptroller, &lsquo;unrequired&rsquo; (not under torture, nor
in answer to a question under examination), that Gowrie, when
abroad, several times said that &lsquo;he was not a wise man
that, having the execution of a high and dangerous purpose,
communicated the same to any but himself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As to this secrecy, we must remember that Gowrie was very
young; that in Italy he may have heard or read of romantic and
crafty plots; and may long have dreamed (as Robert
Oliphant&rsquo;s reported allegation declared) of some such
scheme as that in which he failed.&nbsp; We must remember, too,
that James&rsquo;s own account at least suggests a plan quite
feasible.&nbsp; To bring James to Gowrie House, early in the day,
when the townsmen were at kirk, to bring him with only three or
four attendants, then to isolate him and carry him off, was far
from impossible; <!-- page 145--><a name="page145"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 145</span>they might hurry him, disguised, to
Dirleton, a castle garrisoned and provisioned, according to
Carey, who reports the version of Gowrie&rsquo;s friends.&nbsp; A
Scottish judge, Gibson (the ancestor of Sir Thomas
Gibson-Carmichael), was later carried from Leith Sands across the
Border, with perfect success.&nbsp; A fault of the plan was that,
once undertaken, it could not be dropped, even though James came
late and well attended.&nbsp; Ruthven could not tell the King
that his story about a captive and a pot of gold was false.&nbsp;
To do that would have subjected him to a charge of treason.&nbsp;
He could have only one motive for thus deceiving his
Majesty.&nbsp; Thus the plot <i>had</i> to go on, even under
circumstances very unfavourable.&nbsp; There was no place for
repentance.</p>
<p>Thus considered, the conspiracy looks like the plot of a
romance, not without meritorious points, but painfully
amateurish.</p>
<p>As proof of Gowrie&rsquo;s guilt, the evidence, I think,
distinctly proves that he intentionally concealed from those
about him the ride of his brother, Henderson, and Andrew Ruthven
to Perth; that he concealed his knowledge, derived from
Henderson, of the King&rsquo;s approach; and that Ruthven
concealed from Craigengelt, on his return, his long ride to
Falkland, saying that he had been on &lsquo;an errand not far
off.&rsquo;&nbsp; Moncrieff swore that Henderson gave him a
similar answer.&nbsp; Asked by Moncrieff where he had been, he
said &lsquo;he had been two or three miles above the
town.&rsquo;&nbsp; Henderson corroborated Moncrieff&rsquo;s
evidence on this point.&nbsp; <!-- page 146--><a
name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>There can
have been no innocent motive for all this secrecy.&nbsp; It would
have been natural for Gowrie to order luncheon for the King to be
prepared, as soon as Henderson arrived.</p>
<p>Finally, the Earl&rsquo;s assertions that James had ridden
away, assertions repeated after he had gone upstairs to inquire
and make sure, are absolutely incompatible with innocence.&nbsp;
They could have only one motive, to induce the courtiers to ride
off and leave the King in his hands.</p>
<p>What was to happen next?&nbsp; Who can guess at the plot of
such a plotter?&nbsp; It is perhaps least improbable that the
King was to be conveyed secretly, by sea or across Fife, to
Dirleton in the first place.&nbsp; Gowrie may have had an
understanding with Guevara at Berwick.&nbsp; James himself told
Nicholson that a large English ship had hovered off the coast,
refusing communication with the shore.&nbsp; Bothwell, again, now
desperate, may have lately been nearer home than was known;
finally, Fastcastle, the isolated eyrie on its perpendicular rock
above the Northern Sea, may have been at Gowrie&rsquo;s
disposal.&nbsp; I am disinclined to conjecture, being only
certain that a young man with Gowrie&rsquo;s
past&mdash;&lsquo;Italianate,&rsquo; and of dubious
religion&mdash;was more apt to form a wild and daring plot than
was his canny senior, the King of Scots.&nbsp; But that a plot of
some kind Gowrie had laid, I am convinced by his secrecy, and by
his falsehoods as to the King&rsquo;s departure.&nbsp; Among the
traps for the King contrived by Bothwell and <!-- page 147--><a
name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>Colville,
and reported by Colville to his English paymasters, were schemes
quite as wild as that which Gowrie probably entertained.&nbsp;
The King once in the pious hands of so godly a man as Gowrie, the
party of the Kirk, or the party of the Church, would have come in
and made themselves useful. <a name="citation147"></a><a

<h2><!-- page 148--><a name="page148"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 148</span>XII.&nbsp; LOGAN OF RESTALRIG</h2>
<p>We now arrive at an extraordinary sequel of the Gowrie
mystery: a sequel in which some critics have seen final and
documentary proof of the guilt of the Ruthvens.&nbsp; Others have
remarked only a squalid intrigue, whereby James&rsquo;s ministers
threw additional disgrace on their master.&nbsp; That they
succeeded in disgracing themselves, we shall make only too
apparent, but if the evidence which they handled proves nothing
against the Ruthvens, it does not on that account invalidate the
inferences which we have drawn as to their conspiracy.&nbsp; We
come to the story of the Laird and the country writer.</p>
<p>That we may know the Laird better, a brief description of his
home may be introduced.&nbsp; Within a mile and a half of the
east end of Princes Street, Edinburgh, lies, on the left of the
railway to the south, a squalid suburb.&nbsp; You drive or walk
on a dirty road, north-eastwards, through unambitious shops,
factories, tall chimneys, flaming advertisements, and houses for
artisans.&nbsp; The road climbs a hill, and you begin to find, on
each side of you, walls of ancient construction, and traces of
great old doorways, now <!-- page 149--><a
name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>condemned.&nbsp; On the left are ploughed fields, and
even clumps of trees with blackened trunks.&nbsp; Grimy are the
stacks of corn in the farmyard to the left, at the crest of the
hill.&nbsp; On the right, a gateway gives on a short avenue which
leads to a substantial modern house.&nbsp; Having reached this
point in my pilgrimage, I met a gentleman who occupies the house,
and asked if I might be permitted to view the site.&nbsp; The
other, with much courtesy, took me up to the house, of which only
the portion in view from the road was modern.&nbsp; Facing the
west all was of the old Scottish ch&acirc;teau style, with
gables, narrow windows, and a strange bulky chimney on the north,
bulging out of the wall.&nbsp; The west side of the house stood
on the very brink of a steep precipice, beneath which lay what is
now but a large deep waterhole, but, at the period of the Gowrie
conspiracy, was a loch fringed with water weeds, and a haunt of
wild fowl.&nbsp; By this loch, Restalrig Loch, the witch more
than three centuries ago met the ghost of Tam Reid, who fell in
Pinkie fight, and by the ghost was initiated into the magic which
brought her to the stake.</p>
<p>I scrambled over a low wall with a deep drop, and descended
the cliff so as to get a view of the ancient ch&acirc;teau that
faces the setting sun.&nbsp; Beyond the loch was a muddy field,
then rows on rows of ugly advertisements, then lines of
&lsquo;smoky dwarf houses,&rsquo; and, above these, clear against
a sky of March was the leonine profile of Arthur&rsquo;s

shrieking southward trains between the loch and the mountain, old
and new were oddly met, for the ch&acirc;teau was the home of an
ancient race, the Logans of Restalrig, ancestors of that last
Laird with whom our story has to do.&nbsp; Their rich lands
stretched far and wide; their huge dovecot stands, sturdy as a
little pyramid, in a field to the north, towards the firth.&nbsp;
They had privileges over Leith Harbour which must have been very
valuable: they were of Royal descent, through a marriage of a
Logan with a daughter of Robert II.&nbsp; But their glory was in
their ancestor, Sir Robert Logan, who fell where the good Lord
James of Douglas died, charging the Saracens on a field of Spain,
and following the heart of Bruce.&nbsp; So Barbour sings, and to
be named by Barbour, for a deed and a death so chivalrous, is
honour enough.</p>

<p>The Logans flourished in their eyrie above the Loch of
Restalrig, and intermarried with the best houses, Sinclairs,
Ogilvys, Homes, and Ramsays of Dalhousie.&nbsp; It may be that
some of them sleep under the muddy floor of St. Triduana&rsquo;s
Chapel, in the village of Restalrig, at the foot of the hill on
the eastern side of their old ch&acirc;teau.&nbsp; This village,
surrounded by factories, is apparently just what it used to be in
the days of James VI.&nbsp; The low thick-walled houses with
fore-stairs, retain their ancient, high-pitched, red-tiled roofs,
with dormer windows, and turn their tall narrow gables to the
irregular street.&nbsp; &lsquo;A mile frae Embro town,&rsquo; you
find yourself going <!-- page 151--><a name="page151"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 151</span>back three hundred years in
time.&nbsp; On the right hand of the road, walking eastward, what
looks like a huge green mound is visible above a high ancient
wall.&nbsp; This is all that is left of St. Triduana&rsquo;s
Chapel, and she was a saint who came from Achaia with St.
Regulus, the mythical founder of St. Andrews.&nbsp; She died at
Restalrig on October 8, 510, and may have converted the Celts,
who then dwelt in a crannog in the loch; at all events we hear
that, in a very dry summer, the timbers of a crannog were found
in the sandy deposit of the lake margin.&nbsp; The chapel (or
chapter-house?), very dirty and disgracefully neglected, has
probably a crypt under it, and certainly possesses a beautiful
groined roof, springing from a single short pillar in the
centre.&nbsp; The windows are blocked up with stones, the
exterior is a mere mound of grass like a sepulchral
tumulus.&nbsp; On the floor lies, broken, the gravestone of a
Lady Restalrig who died in 1526.&nbsp; Outside is a patched-up
church; the General Assembly of 1560 decreed that the church
should be destroyed as &lsquo;a monument of idolatry&rsquo; (it
was a collegiate church, with a dean, and prebendaries), and in
1571 the wrought stones were used to build a new gate inside the
Netherbow Port.&nbsp; The whole edifice was not destroyed, but
was patched up, in 1836, into a Presbyterian place of
worship.&nbsp; This old village and kirk made up &lsquo;Restalrig
Town,&rsquo; a place occupied by the English during the siege of
Leith in 1560.&nbsp; So much of history may be found in this odd
corner, where the sexton of the kirk speaks to the <!-- page
152--><a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
152</span>visitor about &lsquo;the Great Logan,&rsquo; meaning
that Laird who now comes into the sequel of the Gowrie
mystery.</p>
<p>For some thirty years before the date of which we are
speaking, a Robert Logan had been laird of Restalrig, and of the
estate of Flemington, in Berwickshire, where his residence was
the house of Gunnisgreen, near Eyemouth, on the Berwickshire
coast.&nbsp; He must have been a young boy when, in 1560, the
English forces besieging Leith (then held by the French for Mary
of Guise) pitched their camp at Restalrig.</p>
<p>In 1573, Kirkcaldy of Grange and Maitland of Lethington
gallantly held the last strength of the captive Mary Stuart, the
Castle of Edinburgh.&nbsp; The fortress was to fall under the
guns of the English allies of that Earl of Gowrie (then Lord
Ruthven), who was the father of the Gowrie of our mystery.</p>
<p>On April 17, 1573, a compact was made between Lord Ruthven and
Drury, the English general.&nbsp; One provision was (the rest do
not here concern us) that Alexander, Lord Home; Lethington; and
Robert Logan of Restalrig, if captured, &lsquo;shall be reserved
to be justified by the laws of Scotland,&rsquo; which means,
hanged by the neck.&nbsp; But neither on that nor on any other
occasion was our Logan hanged. <a name="citation152"></a><a
href="#footnote152" class="citation">[152]</a>&nbsp; He somehow
escaped death and forfeiture, when Kirkcaldy was gibbeted after
the fall of the castle.&nbsp; In 1577, <!-- page 153--><a
name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>we find
him, with Lord Lindsay and Mowbray of Barnbogle (now Dalmeny)
surety for Queen Mary&rsquo;s half-brother, the Lord Robert
Stewart, who vainly warned Darnley to escape from Kirk o&rsquo;
Field.&nbsp; Lord Robert was then confined by the Regent Morton
in Linlithgow, and Logan with the rest was surety in
10,000<i>l.</i> that he would not attempt to escape.&nbsp; Later,
Logan was again surety that Lord Robert would return after
visiting his dominions, the Orkney Islands. <a
name="citation153"></a><a href="#footnote153"
class="citation">[153]</a></p>
<p>Logan, though something of a pirate, was clearly a man of
substance and of a good house, which he strengthened by
alliances.&nbsp; One of his wives, Elizabeth Macgill, was the
daughter of the Laird of Cranstoun Riddell, and one of her family
was a member of the Privy Council.&nbsp; From Elizabeth Logan was
divorced; she was, apparently, the mother of his eldest son,
Robert.&nbsp; By the marriage of an ancestor of Logan&rsquo;s
with an heiress of the family of Hume, he acquired the fortress
and lands of Fastcastle, near St. Abbs, on the Berwickshire
coast.&nbsp; The castle, now in ruins, is the model of Wolfscrag
in &lsquo;The Bride of Lammermoor.&rsquo;&nbsp; Standing on the
actual verge of a perpendicular cliff above the sea, whence it is
said to have been approached by a staircase cut in the living
rock, it was all but inaccessible, and was strongly
fortified.&nbsp; Though commanded by the still higher cliff to
the south, under which it nestled on its narrow plateau of rock,
Fastcastle was <!-- page 154--><a name="page154"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 154</span>then practically impregnable, and
twenty men could have held it against all Scotland.&nbsp; Around
it was, and is, a roadless waste of bent and dune, from which it
was severed by a narrow rib of rock jutting seawards, the ridge
being cut by a cavity which was spanned by a drawbridge.&nbsp;
Master of this inaccessible eyrie, Logan was most serviceable to
the plotters of these troubled times.</p>
<p>His religion was doubtful, his phraseology could glide into
Presbyterian cant, but we know that he indifferently lent the
shelter of his fastness to the Protestant firebrand, wild Frank
Stewart, Earl of Bothwell (who, like Carey writing from Berwick
to Cecil, reckons Logan among Catholics), or to George Ker, the
Catholic intriguer with Spain.&nbsp; Logan loved a plot for its
own sake, as well as for chances of booty and promotion.&nbsp; He
was a hard drinker, and associate of rough yeomen and lairds like
Ninian Chirnside of Whitsumlaws (Bothwell&rsquo;s emissary to the
wizard, Richard Graham), yet a man of ancient family and high
connections.&nbsp; He seems to have been intimate with the family
of Sir John Cranstoun of Cranstoun.&nbsp; On one occasion he
informs Archibald Douglas, the detested and infamous murderer and
deeply dyed traitor, that &lsquo;John of Cranstoun is the one man
now that bears you best good will.&rsquo;&nbsp; (January
1587?)</p>

</a></p>
<p>In January 1600, the year of the Gowrie plot, we find Sir John
Cranstoun in trouble for harbouring an outlawed Mr. Thomas
Cranstoun, who was, with <!-- page 155--><a
name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>Douglas,
the Laird of Spot, one of Bothwell&rsquo;s allies in all his most
desperate raids on the person of King James.&nbsp; In 1592, Mr.
Thomas Cranstoun was forfeited, he was informed against for
&lsquo;new conspiracies against his Majesty&rsquo;s life and
estate,&rsquo; and, in January 1600, Sir John Cranstoun was
sheltering this dangerous and desperate Bothwellian outlaw, as
was his son-in law, Mr. William Cranstoun. <a
name="citation155a"></a><a href="#footnote155a"
class="citation">[155a]</a></p>
<p>Now the Mr. Thomas Cranstoun who was hanged for his part in
the Gowrie affair, was brother of Sir John Cranstoun of
Cranstoun, the ally of that other Mr. Thomas Cranstoun who was so
deep in Bothwell&rsquo;s wild raids on the King&rsquo;s
person.&nbsp; In the spring of 1600 (as we have said, but must
here repeat) there were reports that Bothwell had secretly
returned to Scotland, and, on April 20, 1600, just before the
date of Gowrie&rsquo;s arrival in Edinburgh from London,
Nicholson reports suspected plots of Archibald Douglas, of John
Colville, a ruined Bothwellian, and a spy, and of the Laird of
Spot. <a name="citation155b"></a><a href="#footnote155b"
class="citation">[155b]</a>&nbsp; This Colville had recently
hinted to Essex that he could do a serviceable enterprise.&nbsp;
&lsquo;As for the service I mean to do, if matters go to the
worst, it shall be such, God willing&mdash;if I lose not my life
in doing thereof&mdash;as no other can do with a million of gold,
and yet I shall not exceed the bonds of humanity,&rsquo; that is,
he will not <i>murder</i> the King.&nbsp; &lsquo;But for
conscience sake and worldly honesty, I must first be <!-- page
156--><a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
156</span>absolved of my natural allegiance.&rsquo;&nbsp; (April
27, 1598; again, October 20, 1598.) <a name="citation156"></a><a
href="#footnote156" class="citation">[156]</a></p>
<p>The point for us to mark is that all these conspirators and
violent men, Bothwell (in exile or secretly in Scotland),
Colville (in 1600 an exile in Paris), the Laird of Spot, the
Cranstouns, the infamous Archibald Douglas, with Richard Douglas
his nephew, and Logan of Restalrig, were united, if not by real
friendship, at least, as Thucydides says, by &lsquo;partnership
in desperate enterprises&rsquo; and by 1600 were active in a
subterranean way.&nbsp; If it is fair to say, <i>noscitur a
sociis</i>, &lsquo;a man is known by the company he keeps,&rsquo;
Logan of Restalrig bears the mark of the secret
conspirator.&nbsp; He had relations with persons more
distinguished than his Chirnsides and Whittingham Douglases,
though they were of near kin to the Earl of Morton.&nbsp; His
mother, a daughter of Lord Gray, married Lord Home, after the
death of Logan&rsquo;s father.&nbsp; The Laird of Restalrig was
thus a half-brother of the new Lord Home, a Warden of the Border,
and also was first cousin of the beautiful, accomplished, and
infamous Master of Gray, the double spy of England and of
Rome.</p>
<p>Logan, too, like the Master, had diplomatic ambitions.&nbsp;
In 1586 (July 29) we find him corresponding with the infamous
Archibald Douglas, one of Darnley&rsquo;s murderers, whom James
had sent, in the crisis of his mother&rsquo;s fate, as his
ambassador to Elizabeth.&nbsp; In 1586, Logan, with two other
Logans, was on the <!-- page 157--><a name="page157"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 157</span>packed jury which acquitted Douglas
of Darnley&rsquo;s murder.&nbsp; Logan was a retainer of
Bothwell, that meteor-like adventurer and king-catcher, and he
asks Douglas to try to procure him employment (of course as a
spy) from Walsingham, the English statesman. <a
name="citation157"></a><a href="#footnote157"
class="citation">[157]</a></p>
<p>In October of the same year, we find the Master of Gray
writing to Douglas, thus: &lsquo;Of late I was forced, at
Restalrig&rsquo;s suit, to pawn some of my plate, and the best
jewel I had, to get him money for his marriage&rsquo;&mdash;his
second marriage, apparently.&nbsp; By December 1586 we find Logan
riding to London, as part of the suite of the Master of Gray, who
was to plead with Elizabeth for Mary&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; He was
the Master&rsquo;s most intimate confidant, and, as such, in
February-March 1587, proposed to sell all his secrets to
Walsingham!&nbsp; Nevertheless, when Gray was driven into exile,
later in 1587, Logan was one of his &lsquo;cautioners,&rsquo; or
sureties.&nbsp; He had been of the party of Gowrie&rsquo;s
father, during that nobleman&rsquo;s brief tenure of power in
1582, 1583, and, when Gowrie fell, Logan was ordered to hand his
eyrie of Fastcastle over, at six hours&rsquo; notice, to the
officers of the King.&nbsp; Through the stormy years of
Bothwell&rsquo;s repeated raids on James (1592&ndash;1594) Logan
had been his partisan, and had been denounced a rebel.&nbsp;
Later he appears in trouble for highway robbery committed by his
retainers.&nbsp; Among the diversions of <!-- page 158--><a
name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>this
country gentleman was flat burglary.&nbsp; In December 1593,
&lsquo;when nichts are lang and mirk,&rsquo; the Laird helped
himself to the plate-chest of William Nesbit of Newton.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Under silence of night he took spuilzie of certain gold
and silver to the value of three thousand merks
Scots.&rsquo;&nbsp; The executors of Nesbit did not bring their
action till after Logan died, in July 1606, &lsquo;in respect the
said clandestine deed and fact came not to our knowledge, nor
light as to who had committed the same,&rsquo; till just before
the action was brought.</p>
<p>In 1599, when conspiracies were in the air, Logan was bound
over not to put Fastcastle in the hands of his Majesty&rsquo;s
enemies and rebels. <a name="citation158"></a><a
href="#footnote158" class="citation">[158]</a></p>
<p>This brief sketch of a turbulent life is derived from
Logan&rsquo;s own letters to Archibald Douglas, now among the
Cecil Papers at Hatfield; from the &lsquo;Papers relating to the
Master of Gray,&rsquo; in which we find Logan, under a cypher
name, betraying the Master, his cousin and ally, and from the
Register of the Privy Council of Scotland, in which all that dead
world, from the King to the crofter, may be traced, often in
circumstances peculiarly private.</p>
<p>At that time, civil processes of &lsquo;horning,&rsquo;
&lsquo;putting to the horn,&rsquo; or outlawry, were the common
resort of creditors against procrastinating debtors.&nbsp; Many
of the most respectable persons, gentlemen and ladies, appear in
these suits; Robert Abercromby sues a lady of rank for
150<i>l.</i> Scots.&nbsp; He is the burgess of <!-- page 159--><a
name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>Edinburgh,
the King&rsquo;s saddler, who, as the Master of Ruthven told
Craigengelt, had brought the King from Falkland to Perth,
&lsquo;to take order for his debt.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now the singular
thing is that we never find Logan of Restalrig recorded as under
&lsquo;horning&rsquo; for debt, whereas, considering his
character, we might expect him never to be free from &lsquo;the
horn.&rsquo;&nbsp; On the other hand, we know him to have been a
lender, not a borrower.&nbsp; He was <i>sui profusus</i>.&nbsp;
On January 1, 1599, Cecil had been making inquiries as to Logan,
from Lord Willoughby commanding at Berwick.&nbsp; Cecil always
had his eyes on Border Scots, likely to be useful in troubling
King James.&nbsp; Willoughby replies, &lsquo;There is sutch a
laird of Lesterigge as you write of, a vain lose man, a greate
favourer of thefes reputed, yet a man of a good clan, as they
here tearme it, and a gud felow.&rsquo; <a
name="citation159"></a><a href="#footnote159"
class="citation">[159]</a></p>
<p>Such was Logan of Restalrig, &lsquo;Old Rugged and
Dangerous.&rsquo;&nbsp; In 1601, May 30, we find him appearing as
surety for Philip Mowbray, one of the Mowbrays of Barnbogle,
whose sister stood by Queen Mary at the scaffold, and whose
brother Francis was with the bold Buccleuch, when he swam
&lsquo;that wan water&rsquo; of Esk, and rescued Kinmont Willie
from Carlisle Castle.&nbsp; This Francis Mowbray and his brother
Philip were (1601&ndash;1603) mixed up with Cecil in some
inscrutable spy-work, and intrigues for the murder of King
James.&nbsp; The Mowbrays were old <!-- page 160--><a
name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>friends of
Logan: they had been engaged in privateering enterprises
together, but could produce no letters of marque!&nbsp; In 1603,
Francis Mowbray, abandoned and extradited by Cecil, was killed in
an attempt to escape from Edinburgh Castle.&nbsp; He had been
accused, by an Italian fencing-master, of a conspiracy to kill
James.&nbsp; Cecil had, of course, by this time made peace and
alliance with James, who was on the point of ascending the
English throne, and he gave up Francis.&nbsp; Mowbray challenged
the Italian fencing-master to judicial combat; the Italian came
down to fight him, the lists were actually pitched at Holyrood,
when (January 31, 1603) Francis preferred to try the chance of
flight; the rope of knotted sheet to which he trusted broke, and
he was dashed to pieces on the Castle rocks. <a
name="citation160a"></a><a href="#footnote160a"
class="citation">[160a]</a></p>
<p>Since 1592, Mowbray had been corresponding with Logan&rsquo;s
friend, Archibald Douglas, and offering his services to
Cecil.&nbsp; To Cecil, in September 1600, he was again applying,
regarding Elizabeth as his debtor.&nbsp; In 1600, he was in touch
with Henry Locke, who had been Cecil&rsquo;s go-between in his
darkest intrigues against James, and his agent with Bothwell,
Atholl, and the Gowrie slain on August 5, 1600.&nbsp; But, in the
autumn of 1602, Cecil had become the secret ally of James, and
gave up poor Francis, a broken tool of his and of
Elizabeth&rsquo;s. <a name="citation160b"></a><a
href="#footnote160b" class="citation">[160b]</a></p>
<p><!-- page 161--><a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
161</span>We have now learned a good deal about Logan&rsquo;s
habitual associates, and we have merely glanced at a few of the
numberless plots against James which were encouraged by the
English Government.&nbsp; If James was nervously apprehensive of
treason, he had good cause.&nbsp; But of Logan at the moment of
the Gowrie Plot, we know nothing from public documents.&nbsp; We
do know, however, on evidence which has previously been in part
unpublished, in part unobserved, that from August 1600 onwards,
Logan was oddly excited and restless.&nbsp; Though not in
debt&mdash;or at least though no record of his
&lsquo;horning&rsquo; exists&mdash;he took to selling his lands,
Restalrig, Flemington, Gunnisgreen, Fastcastle. <a
name="citation161"></a><a href="#footnote161"
class="citation">[161]</a>&nbsp; After 1600 he sold them all; he
wallowed in drink; he made his wife wretched; with his eldest son
he was on ill terms; he wandered to London, and to France in
1605, and he returned to die (of plague, it seems) in the
Canongate, a landless but a monied man, in July 1606.</p>
<p>Why did Logan sell all his lands, investing in shipping
property?&nbsp; The natural inference, at the time, was that he
had been engaged in &lsquo;some ill turn,&rsquo; some mysterious
conspiracy, and people probably (certainly, if we believe the
evidence to follow) thought that he had been an accomplice in the
Gowrie affair.</p>
<p>He died, and his children by his first wives dissociated
themselves from his executorship.&nbsp; The <!-- page 162--><a
name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>bulk of it
was the unpaid part of the purchase money for his lands, sold by
him to Balmerino, and Dunbar, James&rsquo;s trusted ministers,
who owed some 33,000 marks to the estate.</p>
<p>Logan had a &lsquo;doer,&rsquo; or law agent, a country
writer, or notary, named Sprot, who dwelt at Eyemouth, a hungry
creature, who did not even own a horse.&nbsp; When Logan rode to
Edinburgh, Sprot walked thither to join him.&nbsp; Yet the two
were boon companions; Sprot was always loitering and watching at
Gunnisgreen, always a guest at the great Christmas festivals,
given by the Laird to his rough neighbours.&nbsp; The death of
Logan was a disaster to Sprot, and to all the parasites of the
Laird.</p>
<p>Logan died, we saw, in July 1606.&nbsp; In April, 1608, Sprot
was arrested by a legal official, named Watty Doig.&nbsp; He had
been blabbing in his cups, it is said, about the Gowrie affair;
certainly most compromising documents, apparently in
Logan&rsquo;s hand, and with his signature, were found on
Sprot&rsquo;s person.&nbsp; They still bear the worn softened
look of papers carried for long in the pockets. <a
name="citation162"></a><a href="#footnote162"
class="citation">[162]</a>&nbsp; Sprot was examined, and
confessed that he knew beforehand of the Gowrie conspiracy, and
that the documents in his possession were written by Logan to
Gowrie and other plotters.&nbsp; He was tortured and in part
recanted; Logan, he said, had <i>not</i> written the guilty
letters: he himself had forged them.&nbsp; This was all before
July 5, 1608, while Mr. Robert Oliphant lay in <!-- page 163--><a
name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>prison, in
London, on the same charge of guilty foreknowledge.&nbsp; Early
in July 1608, the Earl of Dunbar came from London to Edinburgh,
to deal with the affairs of the Kirk.&nbsp; He took Sprot out of
his dungeon, gave him a more wholesome chamber, secluded him from
gentlemen who came and threatened him (or so he said) if he made
revelations, and Dunbar provided him with medical
attendance.&nbsp; The wounds inflicted in &lsquo;the boot&rsquo;
were healed.</p>
<p>For six weeks Sprot was frequently examined, before members of
the Privy Council and others, without torture.&nbsp; What he said
the public did not know, nor, till now, have historians been
better informed.&nbsp; Throughout, after July 5, 1608, he
persisted in declaring Logan&rsquo;s complicity in the Gowrie
conspiracy, and his own foreknowledge.&nbsp; He was tried, solely
on the evidence of guilty foreknowledge alleged in his own
confessions, and of extracts, <i>given by him from memory
only</i>, of a letter from Gowrie to Logan (<i>not</i> one of
those which he claimed to have forged), and another of Logan to
Gowrie, both of July 1600.&nbsp; On August 12, Sprot was hanged
at Edinburgh.&nbsp; He repeated his confession of guilt from
every corner of the scaffold.&nbsp; He uttered a long religious
speech of contrition.&nbsp; Once, he said, he had been nearly
drowned: but God preserved him for this great day of confession
and repentance.&nbsp; But &lsquo;no unbeliever in the guilt of
Gowrie,&rsquo; says Calderwood, &lsquo;was one whit the more
convinced.&rsquo;&nbsp; Of course not, nor would the death of
Henderson&mdash;which they <!-- page 164--><a
name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>clamoured
for&mdash;have convinced them.&nbsp; They said, falsely, that
Sprot was really condemned as a forger, and, having to die, took
oath to his guilt in the Gowrie conspiracy, in consideration of
promises of help to his wife and family. <a
name="citation164"></a><a href="#footnote164"
class="citation">[164]</a></p>
<p>Nearly a year later, in June 1609, the exhumed remains of
Logan were brought into court (a regular practice in the case of
dead traitors), and were tried for treason.&nbsp; Five letters by
Logan, of July 1600, were now produced.&nbsp; Three were from
Logan to conspirators unnamed and unknown.&nbsp; One was to a
retainer and messenger of his, Laird Bower, who had died in
January 1606.&nbsp; These letters were declared, by several
honourable witnesses, to be in Logan&rsquo;s very unusual
handwriting and orthography: they were <!-- page 165--><a
name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>compared
with many genuine letters of his, and no difference was
found.&nbsp; The Parliamentary Committee, &lsquo;The Lords of the
Articles,&rsquo; previously sceptical, were convinced by the five
letters, the evidence to handwriting, the energy of the Earl of
Dunbar, and the eloquence of the King&rsquo;s Advocate.&nbsp;
Logan&rsquo;s children were all forfeited, and Dunbar saved the
money which he owed to Logan&rsquo;s estate.&nbsp; This trial is
not alluded to, either by Calderwood or Archbishop Spottiswoode,
in their histories.&nbsp; The five letters produced in the trial
of Logan exist, and have been accepted as authentic by Mr. Tytler
and Mr. Hill Burton, but not by writers who favour the
Ruthvens.&nbsp; We print all five letters in Appendix C.</p>
<p>Meanwhile what had Sprot really said, under private
examination, between July 5 and August 12, 1608, when he was
executed?</p>
<p>This question is to be answered, from the hitherto unpublished
records, in the following chapters.&nbsp; But, in common charity,
the reader must be warned that the exposition is inevitably
puzzling and complex.&nbsp; Sprot, under examination, lied often,
lied variously, and, perhaps, lied to the last.&nbsp; Moreover
much, indeed everything, depends here on exact dates, and
Sprot&rsquo;s are loose, as was natural in the circumstances, the
events of which he spoke being so remote in time.</p>
<p>Consequently the results of criticism of his confession may
here be stated with brevity.&nbsp; The persevering student, the
reader interested in odd <!-- page 166--><a
name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>pictures of
domestic life, and in strange human characters may read on at his
own peril.&nbsp; But the actual grains of fact, extracted from
tons of falsehood, may be set down in very few words.</p>
<p>The genuine and hitherto unknown confessions of Sprot add no
absolute certainty as to the existence of a Gowrie
conspiracy.&nbsp; His words, when uncorroborated, can have no
weight with a jury.&nbsp; He confessed that <i>all</i> the
alleged Logan papers which, up to two days before his death, were
in possession of the Privy Council, were forgeries by
himself.&nbsp; But, on August 10, he announced that he had
possessed one <i>genuine</i> letter of Logan to Gowrie (dated
July 29, 1600).&nbsp; That letter (our Letter IV) or a forged
copy was then found in his repositories.&nbsp; Expert evidence,
however, decides that this document, like all the others, is in a
specious imitation of Logan&rsquo;s hand, but that it has other
characteristics of Sprot&rsquo;s own hand, and was penned by
Sprot himself.&nbsp; Why he kept it back so long, why he declared
that it alone was genuine, we do not know.&nbsp; That it
<i>is</i> genuine, <i>in substance</i>, and was copied by Sprot
from a real letter of Logan&rsquo;s in an imitation of
Logan&rsquo;s hand, and that, if so, it proves Logan&rsquo;s
accession to the conspiracy, is my own private opinion.&nbsp; But
that opinion is based on mere literary considerations, on what is
called &lsquo;internal evidence,&rsquo; and is, therefore, purely
a matter of subjective impression, like one&rsquo;s idea of the
possible share of Shakespeare in a play mainly by Fletcher or
another.&nbsp; Evidence of <!-- page 167--><a
name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>this kind
is not historical evidence.&nbsp; It follows that the whole
affair of Sprot, and of the alleged Logan letters, adds nothing
certain to the reasons for believing that there was a Gowrie
conspiracy.&nbsp; As far as Sprot and his documents are
concerned, we know that all, as they stand, are pure fictitious
counterfeits by that unhappy man, while, as to whether one letter
(IV) and perhaps another (I) are genuine <i>in substance</i>,
every reader must form his own opinion, on literary grounds, and
no opinion is of much value.&nbsp; Such is a brief summary of the
facts.&nbsp; But the tenacious inquirer who can follow us through
the tangled mazes of Sprot&rsquo;s private confessions, will
perhaps agree with me that they contain distinguishable grains of
fact, raising a strong surmise that Logan was really involved
with Gowrie in a plot.&nbsp; Yet this, again, is a subjective
impression, which may vary with each reader.</p>
<h2><!-- page 168--><a name="page168"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 168</span>XIII.&nbsp; THE SECRETS OF
SPROT</h2>
<p>The final and deepest mystery of the mysterious Gowrie affair
rises, like a mist from a marsh, out of these facts concerning
Sprot.&nbsp; When he was convicted, and hanged, persisting in his
confessions, on August 12, 1608, no letters by Gowrie, or any
other conspirator, were produced in Court.&nbsp; Extracts,
however, of a letter from Gowrie to Logan, and of one from Logan
to Gowrie, were quoted in Sprot&rsquo;s formal Indictment.&nbsp;
They were also quoted in an official publication, an account of
Sprot&rsquo;s case, prepared by Sir William Hart, the Chief
Justice, and issued in 1608.&nbsp; Both these documents (to which
we return) are given by Mr. Pitcairn, in the second volume of his
&lsquo;Criminal Trials.&rsquo;&nbsp; But later, when the dead
Logan was tried in 1609, five of his alleged plot letters (never
<i>publicly</i> mentioned in Sprot&rsquo;s trial) were produced
by the prosecution, and not one of these was identical with the
letter of Logan cited in the Indictment of Sprot, and in the
official account of his trial.&nbsp; There were strong
resemblances between Logan&rsquo;s letter, quoted but not
produced, in 1608, and a letter of Logan&rsquo;s produced, <!--
page 169--><a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
169</span>and attested to be in his handwriting, in 1609.&nbsp;
But there were also remarkable variations.</p>
<p>Of these undeniable facts most modern historians who were
convinced of the guilt of the Ruthvens take no notice; though the
inexplicable discrepancies between the Logan letters
<i>quoted</i> in 1608, and the letters <i>produced</i> as his in
1609, had always been matters of comment and criticism.</p>
<p>As to the letters of 1609, Mr. Tytler wrote, &lsquo;their
import cannot be mistaken; <i>their authenticity has never been
questioned</i>; they still exist . . . &rsquo;&nbsp; Now
assuredly the letters exist.&nbsp; The five alleged originals
were found by Mr. Pitcairn, among the Warrants of Parliament, in
the General Register House, in Edinburgh, and were published by
him, but without their endorsements, in his &lsquo;Criminal
Trials&rsquo; in Scotland. (1832). <a name="citation169"></a><a
href="#footnote169" class="citation">[169]</a>&nbsp; Copies of
the letters are also &lsquo;bookit,&rsquo; or engrossed, in the
Records of Parliament.&nbsp; These &lsquo;bookit&rsquo;
transcripts were made carelessly, and the old copyist was puzzled
by the handwriting and orthography of the alleged originals
before him.&nbsp; The controversy about the genuineness of the
five letters took new shapes after Mr. Pitcairn discovered those
apparently in Logan&rsquo;s hand, and printed them in 1832.&nbsp;
Mr. Hill Burton accepts them with no hint of doubt, and if Mr.
Tytler was the most learned and impartial, Mr. Hill Burton was
the most sceptical of our historians.&nbsp; Yet on this point of
authenticity these historians were too hasty.&nbsp; The
authenticity of the <!-- page 170--><a name="page170"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 170</span>letters (except one, No. IV) was
denied by the very man, Sprot, in whose possession most of them
were originally found. <a name="citation170"></a><a
href="#footnote170" class="citation">[170]</a>&nbsp; The evidence
of his denial has been extant ever since Calderwood wrote, who
tells us, clearly on the authority of an older and anonymous
History in MS. (now in the Advocates&rsquo; Library), that Sprot,
when first taken (April 13&ndash;19, 1608), accused Logan of
writing the letters, but withdrew the charge under torture, and
finally, when kindly treated by Lord Dunbar, and healed of his
wounds, declared that he himself had forged all the Logan letters
(save one).&nbsp; Yet Logan was, to Sprot&rsquo;s certain
knowledge (so Sprot persistently declared), involved in the
Gowrie conspiracy.</p>
<p>Now assuredly this appeared to be an incredible assertion of
Calderwood, or of his MS. source.&nbsp; He was a stern
Presbyterian, an enemy of the King (who banished him), and an
intimate friend of the Cranstoun family, who, in 1600, were
closely connected with conspirators of their name.&nbsp; Thus
prejudiced, Calderwood was believed by Mr. Pitcairn to have made
an untrue or confused statement.&nbsp; Logan is in a plot; Sprot
knows it, and yet Sprot forges letters to prove Logan&rsquo;s
guilt, and these letters, found in Sprot&rsquo;s possession,
prove his own guilty knowledge.&nbsp; There seems no sense in
such behaviour.&nbsp; It might have been guessed that Sprot knew
of Logan&rsquo;s guilt, but had no documentary <!-- page 171--><a
name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>evidence of
it, and therefore forged evidence for the purpose of extorting
blackmail from Logan.&nbsp; But, by 1608, when Sprot was arrested
with some of the documents in his pocket, Logan had been dead for
nearly two years.</p>
<p>The guess, that Sprot knew of Logan&rsquo;s treason, but
forged the proof of it, for purposes of blackmailing him, was not
made by historians.&nbsp; The guess was getting
&lsquo;warm,&rsquo; as children say in their game, was very near
the truth, but it was not put forward by criticism.&nbsp;
Historians, in fact, knew that Logan would not have stood an
attempt at extortion.&nbsp; He was not that kind of man.&nbsp; In
1594, he made a contract with Napier of Merchistoun, the inventor
of Logarithms.&nbsp; Tradition declared that there was a hoard of
gold in &lsquo;the place of Fastcastle.&rsquo;&nbsp; Napier was
to discover it (probably by the Divining Rod), and Logan was to
give him a third of the profits.&nbsp; But Napier, knowing his
man, inserted a clause in the deed, to the effect that, after
finding the gold, <i>he was to be allowed a free exit from
Fastcastle</i>.&nbsp; Whether he found the hoard or not, we do
not know.&nbsp; But, two years later, in letting a portion of his
property, Napier introduced the condition that his tenant should
never sublet it to any person of the name of Logan!&nbsp; If he
found the gold he probably was not allowed to carry off his third
share.&nbsp; Logan being a resolute character of this kind,
Sprot, a cowering creature, would not forge letters to blackmail
him.&nbsp; He would have been invited to dine at
Fastcastle.&nbsp; <!-- page 172--><a name="page172"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 172</span>The cliffs are steep, the sea is
deep, and tells no tales.</p>
<p>Thus where was Sprot&rsquo;s motive for forging letters in
Logan&rsquo;s hand, and incriminating the Laird of Restalrig, and
for carrying them about in his pocket in 1608?&nbsp; But where
was his motive for confessing when taken and examined that he
<i>did</i> forge the letters, if his confession was untrue, while
swearing, to his certain destruction, that he had a guilty
foreknowledge of the Gowrie conspiracy?&nbsp; He <i>might</i>
conciliate Government and get pardoned as King&rsquo;s evidence,
by producing what he called genuine Logan letters, and thus
proving the conspiracy, and clearing the King&rsquo;s character;
but this he did not do.&nbsp; He swore to the last that Logan and
he were both guilty (so Calderwood&rsquo;s authority rightly
reported), but that the plot letters were forged by himself, to
what end Calderwood did not say.&nbsp; All this appeared
midsummer madness.&nbsp; Calderwood, it was argued, must be in
error.</p>
<p>A theory was suggested that Sprot really knew nothing of the
Gowrie mystery; that he had bragged falsely of his knowledge, in
his cups; that the Government pounced on him, made him forge the
letters of Logan to clear the King&rsquo;s character by proving a
conspiracy, and then hanged him, still confessing his
guilt.&nbsp; But Mr. Mark Napier, a learned antiquary, replied
(in a long Appendix to the third volume of the History by the
contemporary Spottiswoode) to this not very probable conjecture
by showing that, <!-- page 173--><a name="page173"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 173</span>when they tried Sprot, Government
produced no letters at all, only an alleged account by Sprot of
two letters unproduced.&nbsp; Therefore, in August 1608, Mr.
Napier argued, Government had no letters; if they had possessed
them, they would infallibly have produced them.&nbsp; That seemed
sound reasoning.&nbsp; In 1608 Government had no plot letters;
therefore, the five produced in the trial of the dead Logan were
forged for the Government, by somebody, between August 1608 and
June 1609.&nbsp; Mr. Napier refused to accept Calderwood&rsquo;s
wild tale that Sprot, while confessing Logan&rsquo;s guilt and
his own, also confessed to having forged Logan&rsquo;s
letters.</p>
<p>Yet Calderwood&rsquo;s version (or rather that of his
anonymous authority in MS.) was literally accurate.&nbsp; Sprot,
in <i>private</i> examinations (July 5, August 11, 1608),
confessed to having forged all the letters but one, the important
one, Letter IV, Logan to Gowrie.&nbsp; This confession the
Government burked.</p>
<p>The actual circumstances have remained unknown and are only to
be found in the official, but <i>suppressed</i>, reports of
Sprot&rsquo;s private examinations, now in the muniment room of
the Earl of Haddington.&nbsp; These papers enable us partly to
unravel a coil which, without them, no ingenuity could
disentangle.&nbsp; Sir Thomas Hamilton, the King&rsquo;s
Advocate, popularly styled &lsquo;Tam o&rsquo; the
Cowgate,&rsquo; from his house in that old &lsquo;street of
palaces,&rsquo; was the ancestor of Lord Haddington, who inherits
his papers.&nbsp; Sir Thomas was an eminent financier, lawyer,
statesman, and <!-- page 174--><a name="page174"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 174</span>historical collector and inquirer,
who later became Lord Binning, and finally Earl of
Haddington.&nbsp; As King&rsquo;s Advocate he held, and
preserved, the depositions, letters, and other documents, used in
the private examinations of Sprot, on and after July 5,
1608.&nbsp; The records of Sprot&rsquo;s examinations between
April 19 and July 5, 1600, are not known to be extant.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas&rsquo;s collection consists of summonses, or drafts
of summonses, for treason, against the dead Logan (1609).&nbsp;
There is also a holograph letter of confession (July 5, 1608)
from Sprot to the Earl of Dunbar.&nbsp; There are the records of
the <i>private</i> examinations of Sprot (July 5-August 11, 1600)
and of other persons whom he more or less implicated.&nbsp; There
are copies by Sprot, in his &lsquo;course,&rsquo; that is,
current, handwriting, of two of the five letters in Logan&rsquo;s
hand (or in an imitation of it).&nbsp; These are letters I and
IV, produced at the posthumous trial of Logan in June 1609.&nbsp;
Finally, there are letters in Logan&rsquo;s hand (or in an
imitation of it), addressed to James Bower and to one Ninian
Chirnside, with allusions to the plot, and there is a long
memorandum of matters of business, also containing hints about
the conspiracy, in Logan&rsquo;s hand, or in an imitation
thereof, addressed to John Bell, and James Bower.</p>
<p>Of these compromising papers, one, a letter to Chirnside, was
found by the Rev. Mr. Anderson (in 1902) torn into thirteen
pieces (whereof one is missing), wrapped up in a sheet of
foolscap of the period.&nbsp; Mr. Anderson has placed the pieces
together, and <!-- page 175--><a name="page175"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 175</span>copied the letter.&nbsp; Of all
these documents, only five letters (those published by Mr.
Pitcairn) were &lsquo;libelled,&rsquo; or founded on, and
produced by the Government in the posthumous trial of Logan
(1609).&nbsp; Not one was produced before the jury who tried
Sprot on August 12, 1608.&nbsp; He was condemned, we said, merely
on his own confession.&nbsp; In his &lsquo;dittay,&rsquo; or
impeachment, and in the official account of the affair, published
in 1608, were cited fragments of two letters <i>quoted from
memory by Sprot under private examination</i>.&nbsp; These
quotations from memory differ, we saw, in many places from any of
the five letters produced in the trial of 1609, a fact which has
aroused natural suspicions.&nbsp; This is the true explanation of
the discrepancies between the plot letter cited in Sprot&rsquo;s
impeachment, and in the Government pamphlet on his case; and the
similar, though not identical, letter produced in 1609.&nbsp; The
indictment and the tract published by Government contain merely
Sprot&rsquo;s recollections of the epistle from Logan to
Gowrie.&nbsp; The letter (IV) produced in 1609 is the genuine
letter of Logan, or so Sprot seems, falsely, to swear.&nbsp;
<i>This</i> document did not come into the hands of Government
till after the Indictment, containing Sprot&rsquo;s quotation of
the letter from memory, was written, or, if it did, was kept
back.</p>
<p>All this has presently to be proved in detail.</p>
<p>As the Government (a fact unknown to our historians) possessed
all the alleged Logan letters <!-- page 176--><a
name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>and papers
<i>before</i> Sprot was hanged, and as, at his trial, they
concealed this circumstance even from Archbishop Spottiswoode
(who was present at Sprot&rsquo;s public trial by jury), a great
deal of perplexity has been caused, and many ingenious but
erroneous conjectures have been invented.&nbsp; The Indictment or
&lsquo;dittay&rsquo; against Sprot, on August 12, 1608, is a
public document, but not an honest one.&nbsp; It contains the
following among other averments.&nbsp; We are told that Sprot, in
July 1600, at Fastcastle, saw and read the beginning of a letter
from Logan to Gowrie (Letter IV).&nbsp; Logan therein expresses
delight at receiving a letter of Gowrie&rsquo;s: he is anxious to
avenge &lsquo;the Macchiavelian massacre of our dearest
friends&rsquo; (the Earl decapitated in 1584).&nbsp; He advises
Gowrie to be circumspect, &lsquo;and be earnest with your
brother, that he be not rash in any speeches touching the purpose
of Padua.&rsquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>This letter, <i>as thus cited</i>, is not among the five later
produced in 1609; it is a blurred reminiscence of parts of
<i>two</i> of them.&nbsp; The reason of these discrepancies is
that the letter is quoted in the Indictment, <i>not</i> from the
document itself (which apparently reach the prosecution after the
Indictment was framed), but from a version given from memory by
Sprot, in one of his private examinations.&nbsp; Next, Sprot is
told in his Indictment that, some time later, Logan asked Bower
to find this letter, which Gowrie, for the sake of secrecy, had
returned to Bower to be delivered to Logan.&nbsp; We know that
this was the <!-- page 177--><a name="page177"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 177</span>practice of intriguers.&nbsp; After
the December riot at Edinburgh in 1596, the Rev. Robert Bruce,
writing to ask Lord Hamilton to head the party of the Kirk, is
said to request him to return his own letter by the bearer.&nbsp;
Gowrie and Logan practised the same method.&nbsp; The indictment
goes on to say that Bower, being unable to read, asked Sprot to
search for Logan&rsquo;s letter to Gowrie, among his papers, that
Sprot found it, &lsquo;abstracted&rsquo; it (stole it), retained
it, and &lsquo;read it divers times,&rsquo; a <i>false quotation
of the MS. confession</i>.&nbsp; Sprot really said that he kept
the stolen letter (IV) &lsquo;<i>till</i>&rsquo; he had framed on
it, as a model, three forged letters.&nbsp; It contained a long
passage of which the &lsquo;substance&rsquo; is quoted.&nbsp;
This passage as printed in Sprot&rsquo;s Indictment is not to be
found textually, in any of the five letters later produced.&nbsp;
It is, we repeat, merely the version given from memory, by Sprot,
at one of his last private examinations, before the letter itself
came into the hands of Government.&nbsp; In either form, the
letter meant high treason.</p>
<p>Such is the evidence of the Indictment against Sprot, of
August 12, 1608.&nbsp; In the light of Sprot&rsquo;s real
confessions, hitherto lying in the Haddington muniment room, we
know the Indictment to be a false and garbled document.&nbsp;
Next, on the part of Government, we have always had a published
statement by Sir William Hart, the King&rsquo;s Justice, with an
introduction by Dr. George Abbot, later Archbishop of Canterbury,
who was in Edinburgh, and present when Sprot was hanged.&nbsp;
This tract was <!-- page 178--><a name="page178"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 178</span>published by Bradewood, London, in
1608, and is reprinted by Pitcairn.</p>
<p>After a verbose, pious, and pedantic diatribe, Abbot comes to
the point.&nbsp; Sprot was arrested in April 1608, first on the
strength &lsquo;of some words that fell from himself,&rsquo; and,
next, &lsquo;<i>of some papers found upon him</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp;
What papers?&nbsp; They are never mentioned in the Indictment of
Sprot.&nbsp; They are never alluded to in the sequel of
Abbot&rsquo;s pamphlet, containing the official account, by Sir
William Hart, of Sprot&rsquo;s Trial and Examinations.&nbsp; In
mentioning &lsquo;some papers found upon&rsquo; Sprot, Dr. Abbot
&lsquo;let the cat out of the bag,&rsquo; but writers like Mr.
Napier, and other sceptics of his way of thinking, deny that any
of the compromising letters were found at all.</p>
<p>No letters, we say, are mentioned by Sir William Hart, in
Abbot&rsquo;s tract (1608), <i>as having been produced</i>.&nbsp;
Archbishop Spottiswoode, who was present at Sprot&rsquo;s public
trial (August 12, 1608), thought the man one of those insane
self-accusers who are common enough, and observes that he did not
&lsquo;show the letter&rsquo;&mdash;that of Logan to Gowrie
(IV).&nbsp; This remark of Spottiswoode, an Archbishop, a
converted Presbyterian, a courtier, and an advocate for the King,
has been a source of joy to all Ruthven apologists.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Spottiswoode saw though the farce,&rsquo; they say;
&lsquo;there was no letter at all, and, courtier and recreant as
he was, Spottiswoode had the honesty to say so in his
History.&rsquo;</p>
<p>To this there used to be no reply.&nbsp; But now we know the
actual and discreditable truth.&nbsp; The Government <!-- page
179--><a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
179</span>was, in fact, engaged in a shameful scheme to which
Archbishops were better not admitted.&nbsp; They meant to use
this letter (IV) on a later occasion, but they also meant to use
some of the other letters which Sprot (unknown to Spottiswoode)
had confessed to be forgeries.&nbsp; The archiepiscopal
conscience might revolt at such an infamy, Spottiswoode might
tell the King, so the Scottish Government did not then allow the
Archbishop, or the public, to know that they had any Logan
letters.&nbsp; No letter at all came into open and public Court
in 1608.&nbsp; Hart cites a short one, from Gowrie to
Logan.&nbsp; Gowrie hopes to see Logan, or, at least, to send a
trusty messenger, &lsquo;anent the purpose you know.&nbsp; But
rather would I wish yourself to come, not only for that errand,
but for some other thing that I have to advise with
you.&rsquo;&nbsp; There is no date of place or day.&nbsp; This
letter, harmless enough, was never produced in Court, and Mr.
Barb&eacute; supposes that it was a concoction of
Hart&rsquo;s.&nbsp; This is an unlucky conjecture.&nbsp; The
Haddington MSS. prove that Sprot really recited Gowrie&rsquo;s
letter, or professed to do so, from memory, in one of his private
examinations.&nbsp; The prosecution never pretended to possess or
produce Gowrie&rsquo;s letter.</p>
<p>Next, Hart cites, <i>as Logan&rsquo;s answer to Gowrie&rsquo;s
first letter</i> (which it was not), the passages already quoted
by the prosecution in Sprot&rsquo;s Indictment, passages out of a
letter of Logan&rsquo;s given by Sprot from memory only.&nbsp;
Hart goes on to describe, as if on Sprot&rsquo;s testimony,
certain movements of the <!-- page 180--><a
name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
180</span>Laird&rsquo;s after he received Gowrie&rsquo;s reply to
his own answer to Gowrie.&nbsp; Logan&rsquo;s letter (as given in
1609) is dated July 29, and it is argued that his movements,
after receiving Gowrie&rsquo;s reply, are inconsistent with any
share in the plot which failed on August 5.&nbsp; Even if it were
so, the fact is unimportant, for Sprot was really speaking of
movements at a date much earlier than July 29; he later gave a
separate account of what Logan was doing at the time of the
outbreak of the plot, an account <i>not</i> quoted by Hart, who
fraudulently or accidentally confused the dates.&nbsp; And next
we find it as good as explicitly stated, by Hart, that this
letter of Logan&rsquo;s to Gowrie was never produced in open
Court.&nbsp; &lsquo;Being demanded where this above written
letter, written by Restalrig to the Earl of Gowrie, which was
returned again by James Bower, is now?&nbsp; Deponeth . . . that
he (Sprot) left the above written letter in his chest, among his
writings, when he was taken and brought away, and that it is
closed and folded within a piece of paper,&rsquo; so Hart
declares in Abbot&rsquo;s tract.&nbsp; He falsified the real
facts.&nbsp; He could not give the question as originally put to
Sprot, for that involved the publication of the fact that all the
letters but one were forged.&nbsp; The question in the authentic
<i>private</i> report ran thus: &lsquo;Demanded where is that
letter which Restalrig wrote to the Earl of Gowrie, <i>whereupon
the said George Sprot wrote and forged the missives
produced</i>?&rsquo;&nbsp; (August 10).</p>
<p>The real letter of Logan to Gowrie, the only <!-- page
181--><a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
181</span>genuine letter (if in any sense genuine), had not on
August 10 been produced.&nbsp; The others were in the hands of
the Government.&nbsp; Hart, in his tract, veils these
circumstances.&nbsp; The Government meant to put the letters to
their own uses, on a later occasion, at the trial of the dead
Logan.</p>
<p>Meanwhile we must keep one fact steadily in mind.&nbsp; When
Sprot confessed to having forged treasonable letters in
Logan&rsquo;s handwriting (as Calderwood correctly reports that
he did confess), he <i>did not include among them Letter IV</i>
(Logan to Gowrie July 29, 1600).&nbsp; <i>That</i> letter was
never heard of by Sprot&rsquo;s examiners till August 10, and
never came into the hands of his examiners till late on August
11, or early on August 12, the day when Sprot was hanged.&nbsp;
Spottiswoode was never made aware that the letter had been
produced.&nbsp; Why Sprot reserved this piece of evidence so
long, why, under the shadow of the gibbet, he at last produced
it, we shall later attempt to explain, though with but little
confidence in any explanation.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at Sprot&rsquo;s public trial in 1608, the
Government were the conspirators.&nbsp; They burked the fact that
they possessed plot-letters alleged to be by Logan.&nbsp; They
burked the fact that Sprot confessed all these, with one or,
perhaps, two exceptions, to be forgeries by himself.&nbsp; What
they quoted, as letters of Logan and Gowrie, were merely
descriptions of such letters given by Sprot from memory of their
contents.</p>
<h2><!-- page 182--><a name="page182"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 182</span>XIV.&nbsp; THE LAIRD AND THE
NOTARY</h2>
<p>We have now to track Sprot through the labyrinth of his
confessions and evasions, as attested by the authentic reports of
his private examinations between July 5 and the day of his
death.&nbsp; It will be observed that, while insisting on his own
guilt, and on that of Logan, he produced no documentary evidence,
no genuine letter attributed by him to Logan, nothing but his own
confessed forgeries, till the cord was almost round his
neck&mdash;if he did then.</p>
<p>In his confessions he paints with sordid and squalid realism,
the life of a debauched laird, tortured by terror, and rushing
from his fears to forgetfulness in wine, travel, and pleasure;
and to strange desperate dreams of flight.&nbsp; As a
&lsquo;human document&rsquo; the confessions of Sprot are unique,
for that period.</p>
<p>On July 5, 1608, Sprot, in prison, wrote, in his own ordinary
hand, the tale of how he knew of Logan&rsquo;s guilt: the letter
was conveyed to the Earl of Dunbar, who, with Dunfermline,
governed Scotland, under the absent King.&nbsp; The prisoner gave
many sources of his knowledge, but the real source, if any
(Letter IV), <!-- page 183--><a name="page183"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 183</span>he reserved till he was certain of
death (August 10).&nbsp; Sprot &lsquo;knew perfectly,&rsquo; he
said, on July 5, that one letter from Gowrie and one from his
brother, Alexander Ruthven, reached Logan, at Fastcastle and at
Gunnisgreen, a house hard by Eyemouth, where Sprot was a notary,
and held cottage land. <a name="citation183"></a><a
href="#footnote183" class="citation">[183]</a>&nbsp; Bower
carried Logan&rsquo;s answers, and &lsquo;long afterwards&rsquo;
showed Sprot &lsquo;the first of Gowrie&rsquo;s letters&rsquo;
(the harmless one about desiring an interview) and also a note of
Logan&rsquo;s to Bower himself, &lsquo;which is amongst the rest
of the letters produced.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is No. II, but in this
confession of July 5, Sprot appears to say that Gowrie&rsquo;s
innocent letter to Logan, asking for an interview, was the source
of his forgeries.&nbsp; &lsquo;I framed them all to the true
meaning and purpose of the letter that Bower let me see, to make
the matter more clear by these arguments and circumstances, for
the cause which I have already&rsquo; (before July 5)
&lsquo;shewn to the Lords&rsquo;&mdash;that is, for purposes of
extorting money from Logan&rsquo;s executors.</p>
<p>This statement was untrue.&nbsp; The brief letter to Logan
from Gowrie was not the model of Sprot&rsquo;s forgeries; as he
later confessed he had another model, in a letter of Logan to
Gowrie, which he held back till the last day of his life.&nbsp;
But in this confession of July 5, Sprot admits that he saw, not
only Gowrie&rsquo;s letter to Logan of July 6 (?) 1600 (a letter
never produced), but also a &lsquo;direction&rsquo; or letter
from Logan to his retainer, Bower, dated <!-- page 184--><a
name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>&lsquo;The
Canongate, July 18, 1600.&rsquo;&nbsp; This is our Letter
II.&nbsp; Had it been genuine, then, taken with Gowrie&rsquo;s
letter to Logan, it must have aroused Sprot&rsquo;s
suspicions.&nbsp; But this Letter II, about which Sprot told
discrepant tales, is certainly not genuine.&nbsp; It is dated, as
we said, &lsquo;The Canongate, July 18, 1600.&rsquo;&nbsp; Its
purport is to inform Bower, then at Brockholes, near Eyemouth,
that Logan had received a <i>new</i> letter from Gowrie,
concerning certain proposals already made orally to him by the
Master of Ruthven.&nbsp; Logan hoped to get the lands of Dirleton
for his share in the enterprise.&nbsp; He ends &lsquo;keep all
things very secret, that my Lord, my brother&rsquo; (Lord Home)
&lsquo;get no knowledge of our purposes, for I&rsquo; (would)
&lsquo;rather be <i>eirdit quick</i>,&rsquo; that is, buried
alive (p. 205).</p>
<p>Now we shall show, later, the source whence Sprot probably
borrowed this phrase as to Lord Home, and being <i>eirdit
quick</i>, which he has introduced into his forged letter.&nbsp;
Moreover, the dates are impossible.&nbsp; The first of the five
letters purports to be from Logan to an unnamed conspirator,
addressed as &lsquo;Right Honourable Sir.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is not
certain whether this letter was in the hands of the prosecution
before the day preceding Sprot&rsquo;s execution, nor is it
certain whether it is ever alluded to by Sprot under
examination.&nbsp; But it is dated from Fastcastle on July 18,
and tells the unknown conspirator that Logan has just heard from
Gowrie.&nbsp; It follows that Logan had heard from Gowrie on July
18 at Fastcastle, that he thence rode <!-- page 185--><a
name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>to
Edinburgh, and from Edinburgh wrote his letter (II) to Bower,
bidding Bower hasten to Edinburgh, to consult.&nbsp; This is
absurd.&nbsp; Logan would have summoned Bower from Fastcastle,
much nearer Bower&rsquo;s home than Edinburgh.&nbsp; Again, in
Letter I, Logan informs the unknown man that he is to answer
Gowrie &lsquo;within ten days at furthest.&rsquo;&nbsp; That
being so, he does not need Bower in such a hurry, unless it be to
carry the letter to the Unknown.&nbsp; But, in that case, he
would have summoned Bower from Fastcastle, he would not have
ridden to Edinburgh and summoned him thence.&nbsp; Once more,
Sprot later confessed, as we shall see, that this letter to Bower
was dictated to himself by Logan, and that the copy produced,
apparently in Logan&rsquo;s hand, was forged by him from the
letter as dictated to him.&nbsp; He thus contradicted his earlier
statement that Letter II was shown to him by Bower.&nbsp; He
never says that he was in Edinburgh with Logan on July 18.&nbsp;
Besides, it is not conceivable that, by dictating Letter II to
Sprot, Logan would have voluntarily put himself in the power of
the notary.</p>
<p>This is a fair example of Sprot&rsquo;s apparently purposeless
lying.&nbsp; His real interest throughout was to persuade the
Government that he was giving them genuine Logan letters.&nbsp;
This, however, he denied, with truth, yet he lied variously about
the nature of his confessed forgeries.</p>
<p>Sprot was so false, that Government might conceive his very
confession of having forged the letters <!-- page 186--><a
name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>to be
untrue.&nbsp; The skill in handwriting of that age could not
detect them for impostures; Government might deem that he had
stolen genuine letters from Bower; letters which might
legitimately be produced as evidence.&nbsp; Indeed this
charitable view is perhaps confirmed by the extraordinary fact,
to be later proved, that three Edinburgh ministers, Mr. Hall, Mr.
Hewat, and Mr. Galloway, with Mr. Lumisden, minister of
Duddingston, were present on occasions when Sprot confessed to
having forged the letters.&nbsp; Yet these four preachers said
nothing, as far as we hear, when the letters, confessedly forged,
were produced as evidence, in 1609, to ruin Logan&rsquo;s
innocent child.&nbsp; Did the preachers think the letters genuine
in spite of the confession that they were forged?&nbsp; We shall
see later, in any case, that the <i>contents</i> of the three
letters to the Unknown, and a torn letter, when compared with
Letter IV, demonstrate that Sprot&rsquo;s final confession to
having forged them on the model of IV is true; indeed the fact
ought to have been discovered, on internal evidence, even by
critics unaware of his confessions.</p>
<p>We now pursue Sprot&rsquo;s written deposition of July
5.&nbsp; He gives, as grounds of his knowledge of Logan&rsquo;s
guilt, certain conversations among Logan&rsquo;s intimates,
yeomen or &lsquo;bonnet lairds,&rsquo; or servants, from which he
inferred that Logan was engaged in treason.&nbsp; Again, just
before Logan&rsquo;s death in July 1606, he was delirious, and
raved of forfeiture.&nbsp; But Logan had been engaged in various
treasons, so <!-- page 187--><a name="page187"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 187</span>his ravings need not refer to the
Gowrie affair.&nbsp; He had been on Bothwell&rsquo;s enterprises,
and had privy dealings with &lsquo;Percy,&rsquo; probably Thomas
Percy, who, in 1602, secretly visited Hume of Manderston, a
kinsman of Logan.&nbsp; That intrigue was certainly connected
merely with James&rsquo;s succession to the English crown.&nbsp;
But one of Logan&rsquo;s retainers, when this affair of Percy was
spoken of among them, said, according to Sprot, that the Laird
had been engaged in treason &lsquo;nearer home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sprot then writes that &lsquo;about the time of the
conspiracy,&rsquo; Logan, with Matthew Logan, rode to Dundee,
where they enjoyed a three days&rsquo; drinking bout, and never
had the Laird such a surfeit of wine.&nbsp; But this jaunt could
not be part of the Gowrie plot, and probably occurred after its
failure.&nbsp; Later, Sprot gave a different version of
Logan&rsquo;s conduct immediately before and after Gowrie&rsquo;s
death.&nbsp; Once more, after Logan&rsquo;s death, one Wallace
asked Sprot to be silent, if ever he had heard of &lsquo;the
Laird&rsquo;s conspiracy.&rsquo;&nbsp; Sprot ended by confessing
contritely that he had forged all the letters (except Letter IV)
&lsquo;to the true meaning and purpose of the letter that Bower
let me see,&rsquo; a passage already quoted, and a falsehood.</p>
<p>What was the &lsquo;cause&rsquo; for which Sprot forged?&nbsp;
It was a purpose to blackmail, not Logan, but Logan&rsquo;s heirs
or executors, one of whom was Lord Home.&nbsp; If Sprot wanted to
get anything out of <i>them</i>, he could terrify them by
threatening to show the forged Logan letters, as genuine, to the
Government, <!-- page 188--><a name="page188"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 188</span>so securing the ruin of
Logan&rsquo;s heirs by forfeiture.&nbsp; He did not do this
himself, but he gave forged letters, for money, to men who were
in debt to the dead Logan&rsquo;s estate, and who might use the
letters to extort remission of what they owed.</p>
<p>On July 15, Sprot was examined before Dunfermline, Dunbar,
Hart, the King&rsquo;s Advocate (Sir Thomas Hamilton), and other
gentlemen.&nbsp; He said that, about July 6, 1600, Logan received
a letter from Gowrie, which, two days later, Bower showed to him
at Fastcastle.&nbsp; This is the harmless Gowrie letter, which
Sprot now quoted from memory, as it is printed in Hart&rsquo;s
official account.</p>
<p>Now begins a new puzzle, caused by Sprot&rsquo;s dates.&nbsp;
Of these we can only give a conjectural version, for the sake of
argument.&nbsp; Logan received a letter from Gowrie about July 6,
1600.&nbsp; He returned a reply, by Bower, but when did Bower
start with the reply?&nbsp; Let us say on July 9.&nbsp; Bower
returned, says Sprot, &lsquo;within five days,&rsquo; with
&lsquo;a new letter&rsquo; from Gowrie.&nbsp; That would bring us
to July 14, but in Letters I and II, dated July 18, Logan is
informing his unknown correspondent, and Bower, of the receipt of
&lsquo;a new letter&rsquo; from Gowrie.&nbsp; Why inform Bower of
this, if Bower was the bearer of the new letter?&nbsp; But the
&lsquo;new letter&rsquo; mentioned in Letters I and II was
brought by a retainer of Gowrie.&nbsp; In any case, supposing by
way of conjecture that Bower returned from Gowrie about July 15,
he spent the night, says Sprot, with Logan at Gunnisgreen, <!--
page 189--><a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
189</span>and next day (July 16) rode to Edinburgh with Bower,
Boig of Lochend, and Matthew Logan.&nbsp; In Edinburgh he
remained &lsquo;a certain short space,&rsquo; say four days,
which would bring us to July 20.&nbsp; Needless to say that this
does not fit Letter II, Logan to Bower, July 18, and Letter I,
Logan to the Unknown, Fastcastle, July 18.</p>
<p>After Logan&rsquo;s return from Edinburgh (which, according to
Sprot, seems to be of about July 20) Sprot heard Logan and Bower
discuss some scheme by which Logan should get Gowrie&rsquo;s
estate of Dirleton, without payment.&nbsp; Bower said nothing
could be done till Logan rode west himself.&nbsp; He discouraged
the whole affair, but Logan said, in the hearing of several
persons, that he would hazard his life with Gowrie.&nbsp; Lady
Restalrig blamed Bower for making Logan try to sell the lands of
Fastcastle (they were not sold till 1602), of which Bower
protested his innocence.&nbsp; This was <i>after</i>
Logan&rsquo;s return from Edinburgh (say July 20; that is, say
five days after Logan&rsquo;s return, say July 25).&nbsp; Bower
and Logan had a long conference in the open air.&nbsp; Sprot was
lounging and spying about beside the river; a sea-fisher had
taken a basket of blenneys, or &lsquo;green-banes.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Logan called to Sprot to bring him the fish, and they all
supped.&nbsp; Before supper, however, Sprot walked about with
Bower, and tried to &lsquo;pump&rsquo; him as to what was going
forward.&nbsp; Bower said that &lsquo;the Laird should get
Dirleton without either gold or silver, but he feared it should
be as dear to him.&nbsp; <!-- page 190--><a
name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>They had
another pie in hand than the selling of land.&rsquo;&nbsp; Bower
then asked Sprot not to meddle, for he feared that &lsquo;in a
few days the Laird would be either landless or
lifeless.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Certainly this is a vivid description; Bower and Logan were
sitting on a bench &lsquo;at the byre end;&rsquo; Sprot, come on
the chance of a supper, was peeping and watching; Peter Mason,
the angler, at the river side, &lsquo;near the stepping
stones,&rsquo; had his basket of blenneys on his honest back, his
rod or net in his hand; the Laird was calling for the fish, was
taking a drink, and, we hope, offering a drink to Mason.&nbsp;
Then followed the lounge and the talk with Bower before supper,
all in the late afternoon of a July day, the yellow light
sleeping on the northern sea below.&nbsp; Vivid this is, and
plausible, but is it true?</p>
<p>We have reached the approximate date of July 25 (though, of
course, after an interval of eight years, Sprot&rsquo;s memory of
dates must be vague).&nbsp; Next day (July 26) Logan, with Bower
and others, rode to Nine Wells (where David Hume the philosopher
was born), thence, the same night, back to Gunnisgreen, next
night, July 27, to Fastcastle, and thence to Edinburgh.&nbsp;
This brings us (allowing freely for error of memory) to about
July 27, &lsquo;the hinder end of July,&rsquo; says Sprot.&nbsp;
If we make allowance for a vagueness of four or five days, this
does not fit in badly.&nbsp; Logan&rsquo;s letter to Gowrie (No.
IV), which Sprot finally said that he used as a model for his
forgeries, is dated &lsquo;Gunnisgreen, July 29.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;At the <!-- page 191--><a name="page191"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 191</span>beginning of August,&rsquo; says
Sprot (clearly there are four or five days lost in the
reckoning), Logan and Bower, with Matthew Logan and Willie
Crockett, rode to Edinburgh, &lsquo;<i>and there stayed three
days</i>, and the Laird, with Matthew Logan, came home, and Bower
came to his own house of the Brockholes, where he stayed four
days,&rsquo; and then was sent for by Logan, &lsquo;and the Laird
was very sad and sorry,&rsquo; obviously because of the failure
of the plot on August 5.</p>
<p>How do these dates fit into the narrative?&nbsp; Logan was at
Gunnisgreen (his letter (IV) proves it) on July 29.&nbsp; (Later
we show another error of Sprot&rsquo;s on this point.)&nbsp; He
writes that he is sending Bower as bearer of his letter to
Gowrie.&nbsp; If Bower left Edinburgh on July 30, he could
deliver the letter to Gowrie, at Perth, on August 2, and be back
in Edinburgh (whither Logan now went) on August 5, and Logan
could leave Edinburgh on August 6, after hearing of the deaths of
his fellow-conspirators.&nbsp; We must not press Sprot too hard
as to dates so remote in time.&nbsp; We may grant that Bower,
bearing Logan&rsquo;s letter of July 29, rode with Logan and the
others to Edinburgh; that at Edinburgh Logan awaited his return,
with a reply; that he thence learned that August 5 was the day
for the enterprise, and that, early on August 6, he heard of its
failure, and rode sadly home: all this being granted for the sake
of argument.</p>
<p>Had the news of August 6 been that the King had mysteriously
disappeared, we may conceive that <!-- page 192--><a
name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 192</span>Logan would
have hurried to Dirleton, met the Ruthvens there, with their
prisoner, and sailed with them to Fastcastle.&nbsp; Or he might
have made direct to Fastcastle, and welcomed them there.&nbsp;
His reason for being at Restalrig or in the Canongate was to get
the earliest news from Perth, brought across Fife, and from
Bruntisland to Leith.</p>
<p>Whether correct or not, this scheme, allowing for lapse of
memory as to dates, is feasible.&nbsp; Who can, remote from any
documents, remember the dates of occurrences all through a month
now distant by eight years?&nbsp; There were no daily newspapers,
no ready means of ascertaining a date.&nbsp; Queen Mary&rsquo;s
accusers, in their chronological account of her movements about
the time of Darnley&rsquo;s death, are often out in their
dates.&nbsp; In legal documents of the period the date of the day
of the month of an event is often left blank.&nbsp; This occurs
in the confirmation of Logan&rsquo;s own will.&nbsp; &lsquo;He
died --- July, 1606.&rsquo;&nbsp; When lawyers with plenty of
leisure for inquiry were thus at a loss for dates of days of the
month (having since the Reformation no Saints&rsquo; days to go
by), Sprot, in prison, might easily go wrong in his
chronology.</p>

</a></p>
<p>In any case, taking Letter IV provisionally as genuine in
substance, we note that, on July 29, Logan did not yet know the
date fixed for Gowrie&rsquo;s enterprise.&nbsp; He suggested
&lsquo;the beginning of harvest,&rsquo; and, by August 5, harvest
had begun.&nbsp; One of the Perth witnesses was reaping in the
&lsquo;Morton haugh,&rsquo; when he heard the town bell call the
citizens to arms.&nbsp; But <!-- page 193--><a
name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>Gowrie must
have acted in great haste, Logan not knowing, till, say, August 2
or 3, the date of a plot that exploded on August 5.</p>
<p>Gowrie may have thought, as Lord Maxwell said when arranging
his escape from Edinburgh Castle, &lsquo;Sic interprysis are
nocht effectuat with deliberationis and advisments, bot with
suddane resolutionis.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is very important, we must freely admit, as an argument
against the theory of carrying James to Logan&rsquo;s impregnable
keep of Fastcastle, that only one question, in our papers, is
asked as to the provisioning of Fastcastle, and <i>that</i>
merely as to the supply of drink!&nbsp; Possibly this had been
ascertained in Sprot&rsquo;s earlier and unrecorded examinations
(April 19-July 5).&nbsp; One poor hogshead of wine (a trifle to
Logan) had been sent in that summer; so Matthew Logan
deponed.&nbsp; As Logan had often used Fastcastle before, for
treasonable purposes, he was not (it may be supposed) likely to
leave it without provisions.&nbsp; Moreover these could be
brought by sea, from Dirleton, where Carey (August 11) says that
Gowrie had stored &lsquo;all his provision.&rsquo;&nbsp; Moreover
Government did not wish to prove intent to <i>kidnap</i> the
King.&nbsp; That was commonly regarded as a harmless
constitutional practice, not justifying the slaughter of the
Ruthvens.&nbsp; From the first, Government insisted that
<i>murder</i> was intended.&nbsp; In the Latin indictment of the
dead Logan this is again dwelt on; Fastcastle is only to be the
<!-- page 194--><a name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
194</span>safe haven of the murderers.&nbsp; This is a misreading
of Letter IV, where Fastcastle is merely spoken of as to be used
for a meeting, and &lsquo;the concluding of our plot.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Thus it cannot be concealed that, on July 29 (granting Letter
IV to have a basis), the plot, as far as Logan knew, was
&lsquo;in the air.&rsquo;&nbsp; If Fastcastle was to be used by
the conspirators, it must have been taken in the rough, on the
chance that it was provided, or that Gowrie could bring his own
supplies from Dirleton by sea.&nbsp; This extreme vagueness
undeniably throws great doubt on Logan&rsquo;s part in the plot;
Letter IV, if genuine, being the source of our perplexity.&nbsp;
But, if it is not genuine, that is, <i>in substance</i>, there is
only rumour, later to be discussed, to hint that Logan was in any
way connected with Gowrie.</p>
<p>We left Bower and Logan conversing dolefully some days after
the failure of the plot.&nbsp; At this point the perhaps
insuperable difficulty arises, why did they not, as soon as they
returned from Edinburgh, destroy every inch of paper connected
with the conspiracy?&nbsp; One letter at least (Logan&rsquo;s to
Gowrie, July 29) was not burned, according to Sprot, but was
later stolen by himself from Bower; though he reserved
<i>this</i> confession to the last day of his life but two.&nbsp;
We might have expected Logan to take the letter from Bower as
soon as they met, and to burn or, for that matter, swallow it if
no fire was convenient!&nbsp; Yet, according to Sprot, in his
final confession, <!-- page 195--><a name="page195"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 195</span>Logan let Bower keep the damning
paper for months.&nbsp; If this be true, we can only say <i>quos
Deus vult perdere prius dementat</i>.&nbsp; People do keep
damning letters, constant experience proves the fact.</p>
<p>After Bower had met Logan in his melancholy mood, he rode
away, and remained absent for four days, on what errand Sprot did
not know, and during the next fortnight, while Scotland was
ringing with the Gowrie tragedy, Sprot saw nothing of Logan.</p>
<p>Next, Logan went to church at Coldinghame, on a Sunday, and
met Bower: next day they dined together at Gunnisgreen.&nbsp;
Bower was gloomy.&nbsp; Logan said, &lsquo;Be it as it will, I
must take my fortune, and I will tell you, Laird Bower, the
scaffold is the best death that a man can die.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Logan, if he said this, must have been drunk; he very often
was.</p>
<p>It was at this point, in answer to a question, that Sprot
confessed that Logan&rsquo;s letter to Bower (No. II) was a
forgery by himself.&nbsp; The actual letter, Sprot said, was
dictated by Logan to him, and he made a counterfeit copy in
imitation of Logan&rsquo;s handwriting.&nbsp; We have stated the
difficulties involved in this obvious falsehood.&nbsp; Sprot was
trying every ruse to conceal his alleged source and model, Letter
IV.</p>
<p>Sprot was next asked about a certain memorandum by Logan
directed to Bower and to one John Bell, in 1605.&nbsp; This
document was actually found in Sprot&rsquo;s
&lsquo;pocquet&rsquo; when he was arrested, and it contained <!--
page 196--><a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
196</span>certain very compromising items.&nbsp; Sprot replied
that he forged the memorandum, in the autumn of 1606, when he
forged the other letters.&nbsp; He copied most of it from an
actual but innocent note of Logan&rsquo;s on business matters,
and added the compromising items out of his own invention.&nbsp;
He made three copies of this forgery, one was produced; he gave
another to a man named Heddilstane or Heddilshaw, a dweller in
Berwick, in September 1607; the third, &lsquo;in course
hand,&rsquo; he gave to another client, &lsquo;the goodman of
Rentoun,&rsquo; Hume.&nbsp; One was to be used to terrorise
Logan&rsquo;s executors, to whom Heddilstane, but not Rentoun,
was in debt.&nbsp; Sprot&rsquo;s words are important.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He omitted nothing that was in the original&rsquo;
(Logan&rsquo;s memorandum on business matters), &lsquo;but
<i>eikit</i>&rsquo; (added) &lsquo;two articles to his copy, the
one concerning Ninian Chirnside&rsquo; (as to a dangerous
plot-letter lost by Bower), &lsquo;the other, where the Laird
ordered Bower to tear his missive letters.&nbsp; <i>He grants
that he wrote another copy with his course hand</i>, <i>copied
from his copy</i>, and gave it to the goodman of Rentoun,&rsquo;
while the copy given to Heddilstane &lsquo;was of his
counterfeited writing,&rsquo; an imitation of Logan&rsquo;s
hand.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>Perhaps Sprot had two methods and scales of blackmail.&nbsp;
For one, he invented damning facts, and wrote them out in
imitation of Logan&rsquo;s writing.&nbsp; The other species was
cheaper: a copy in his &lsquo;course hand&rsquo; of his more
elaborate forgeries in Logan&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; Now the two
copies of Letters I and IV, <!-- page 197--><a
name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>which, at
the end of his life, as we shall see, Sprot attested by signed
endorsements, were in his &lsquo;course hand.&rsquo;&nbsp; He had
them ready for customers, when he was arrested in April 1608, and
they were doubtless found in his &lsquo;kist&rsquo; on the day
before his death, with the alleged original of Letter IV.&nbsp;
Up to August 11, at a certain hour, Government had neither the
alleged original, nor Sprot&rsquo;s &lsquo;course hand
copy&rsquo; of Letter IV, otherwise he would not have needed to
quote IV from memory, as he did on that occasion.</p>
<p>Among these minor forgeries, to be used in blackmailing
operations, was a letter nominally from Logan to one Ninian or
Ringan Chirnside.&nbsp; This man was a member of the family of
Chirnside of Easter Chirnside; his own estate was
Whitsumlaws.&nbsp; All these Chirnsides and Humes of Berwickshire
were a turbulent and lawless gang, true borderers.&nbsp; Ninian
is addressed, by Logan, as &lsquo;brother;&rsquo; they were most
intimate friends.&nbsp; It was Ninian who (as the endorsement
shows) produced our Letter V, on April 19; he had purchased it,
for the usual ends, from Sprot, being a great debtor (as
Logan&rsquo;s will proves) to his estate.</p>
<p>To track these men through the background of history is to
have a notion of the Day of Judgment.&nbsp; Old forgotten
iniquities and adventures leap to light.&nbsp; Chirnside, like
Logan and the Douglases of Whittingham, and John Colville, and
the Laird of Spot, had followed the fortunes of wild Frank
Stewart, <!-- page 198--><a name="page198"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 198</span>Earl of Bothwell, and nephew of the
Bothwell of Queen Mary.&nbsp; Frank Bothwell was driven into his
perilous courses by a charge of practising witchcraft against the
King&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; Absurd as this sounds, Bothwell had
probably tried it for what it was worth.&nbsp; When he was
ruined, pursued, driven, child of the Kirk as he seemed, into the
Catholic faction, his old accomplice, Colville, took a solemn
farewell of him.&nbsp; &lsquo;By me your lordship was cleared of
the odious imputation of witchcraft . . . but God only knows how
far I hazarded my conscience in making black white, and darkness
light for your sake&rsquo; (September 12, 1594). <a
name="citation198"></a><a href="#footnote198"
class="citation">[198]</a></p>
<p>After Bothwell, when he trapped the King by aid of Lady Gowrie
(July 1593), recovered power for a while, he defended himself on
this charge of witchcraft.&nbsp; He <i>had</i> consulted and
employed the wizard, Richard Graham, who now accused him of
attempting the King&rsquo;s life by sorcery.&nbsp; But he had
only employed Graham to heal the Earl of Angus, himself dying of
witchcraft.&nbsp; Bothwell was charged with employing a retainer,
<i>Ninian</i> Chirnside, to arrange more than twenty-one meetings
with the wizard Graham; the result being the procurement of a
poison, &lsquo;adder skins, toad skins, and the hippomanes in the
brain of a young foal,&rsquo; to ooze the juices on the King,
&lsquo;a poison of such vehemency as should have presently cut
him off.&rsquo;&nbsp; Isobel Gowdie, accused of witchcraft in
1622, confessed to having employed <!-- page 199--><a
name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>a similar
charm. <a name="citation199a"></a><a href="#footnote199a"
class="citation">[199a]</a>&nbsp; All this Bothwell, instructed
by Colville, denied, but admitted that he had sent Ninian
Chirnside twice to the wizard, all in the interests of the dying
Earl of Angus. <a name="citation199b"></a><a href="#footnote199b"
class="citation">[199b]</a></p>
<p>This Chirnside, then, was a borderer prone to desperate
enterprises and darkling rides, and midnight meetings with the
wizard Graham in lonely shepherds&rsquo; cottages, as was
alleged.&nbsp; He could also sink to blackmailing the orphan
child of his &lsquo;brother,&rsquo; Logan of Restalrig.</p>
<p>To go on with Sprot&rsquo;s confessions; he had forged, he
said, receipts from Logan to the man named Edward or Ned
Heddilstane for some of the money which Heddilstane owed
him.&nbsp; For these forgeries his client paid him well, if not
willingly.&nbsp; Sprot frequently blackmailed Ned,
&lsquo;whenever he want siller.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It must be granted that Sprot was a liar so complex, and a
forger so skilled (for the time, that is), that nothing which he
said or produced can be reckoned, as such, as evidence.&nbsp; On
the other hand, his power of describing or inventing scenes, real
or fictitious, was of high artistic merit, so that he appears
occasionally either to deviate into truth, or to have been a
realistic novelist born centuries too early.&nbsp; Why then, it
may be asked, do we doubt that Sprot may have forged, without a
genuine model, Letter IV?&nbsp; The answer will appear in due
time.&nbsp; Letter IV, as Sprot confessed, is certainly the model
of all the letters <!-- page 200--><a name="page200"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 200</span>which he forged, whether those
produced or those suppressed.&nbsp; He was afraid to wander from
his model, which he repeated in Letters I (?), III, V, and in the
unproduced letters, including one which we have found in twelve
torn fragments, with the signature missing.</p>
<h2><!-- page 201--><a name="page201"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 201</span>XV.&nbsp; THE FINAL CONFESSIONS OF
THE NOTARY</h2>
<p>On July 16, Sprot was again examined.&nbsp; Spottiswoode,
Archbishop of Glasgow, the historian, was present, on this
occasion only, with Dunfermline, Dunbar, Sir Thomas Hamilton,
Hart, and other nobles and officials.&nbsp; None of them signs
the record, which, in this case only, is merely attested by the
signature of Primrose, the Clerk of Council, one of Lord
Rosebery&rsquo;s family.&nbsp; In this session Sprot said nothing
about forging the letters.&nbsp; The Archbishop was not to
know.</p>
<p>Asked if he had any more reminiscences, Sprot said that, in
November 1602, Fastcastle having been sold, Logan asked Bower
&lsquo;for God&rsquo;s sake&rsquo; to bring him any of the
letters about the Gowrie affair which he might have in
keeping.&nbsp; Bower said that he had no dangerous papers except
one letter from Alexander Ruthven, and another from &lsquo;Mr.
Andro Clerk.&rsquo;&nbsp; This Clerk was a Jesuit, who chiefly
dealt between Spain and the Scotch Catholics.&nbsp; He was
involved in the affair called &lsquo;The Spanish Blanks&rsquo;
(1593), and visited the rebel Catholic peers of the North, Angus,
<!-- page 202--><a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
202</span>Errol, and Huntly. <a name="citation202"></a><a
href="#footnote202" class="citation">[202]</a> Logan, like
Bothwell, was ready to intrigue either with the Kirk or the
Jesuits, and he seems to have had some personal acquaintance with
Father Andrew.</p>
<p>Bower left Logan, to look for these letters at his own house
at Brockholes, and Logan passed a night of sleepless
anxiety.&nbsp; One of the mysteries of the case is that Logan
entrusted Bower, who could not read, with all his papers.&nbsp;
If one of them was needed, Bower had to employ a person who could
read to find it: probably he used, as a rule, the help of his
better educated son, Valentine.&nbsp; After Logan&rsquo;s
restless night, Bower returned with the two letters,
Ruthven&rsquo;s and Clerk&rsquo;s, which Logan &lsquo;burned in
the fire.&rsquo;</p>
<p>(Let it be remembered that Sprot has not yet introduced Letter
IV into his depositions, though that was by far the most
important.)</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>After burning Clerk&rsquo;s and Ruthven&rsquo;s letters, Logan
dictated to Sprot a letter to John Baillie of Littlegill,
informing him of the fact.&nbsp; Bower rode off with the letter,
and Logan bade Sprot be silent about all these things, for he had
learned, from Bower, that Sprot knew a good deal.&nbsp; Here the
amateur of the art of fiction asks, why did Sprot drag in Mr.
John Baillie of Littlegill?&nbsp; If Logan, as Sprot swore,
informed Baillie about the burned letters, then Baillie had a
guilty knowledge of the conspiracy.&nbsp; Poor Baillie was
instantly &lsquo;put in ward&rsquo; <!-- page 203--><a
name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 203</span>under the
charge of the Earl of Dunfermline.&nbsp; But, on the day after
Sprot was hanged, namely on August 13, Baillie was set free, on
bail of 10,000 marks to appear before the Privy Council if called
upon.&nbsp; Three of Sprot&rsquo;s other victims, Maul, Crockett,
and William Galloway, were set free on their personal
recognisances, but Mossman and Matthew Logan were kept in prison,
and Chirnside was not out of danger of the law for several years,
as we learn from the Privy Council Register.&nbsp; Nothing was
ever proved against any of these men.&nbsp; After the posthumous
trial of Logan (June 1609) the King bade the Council discharge
John Baillie from his bail, &lsquo;as we rest now fully persuaded
that there was no just cause of imputation against the said
John.&rsquo;&nbsp; So the Register of the Privy Council informs
us. <a name="citation203"></a><a href="#footnote203"
class="citation">[203]</a>&nbsp; Thus, if Sprot told the truth
about all these men, no corroborative facts were discovered,
while the only proofs of his charges against Logan were the
papers which, with one exception, he confessed to be forgeries,
executed by himself, for purposes of extortion.</p>
<p>To go on with his confessions: The Christmas of 1602 arrived,
and &lsquo;The Laird keepit ane great Yule at
Gunnisgreen.&rsquo;&nbsp; On the third day of the feast, Logan
openly said to Bower, at table, &lsquo;I shall sleep better this
night than that night when I sent you for the letters&rsquo; (in
November), &lsquo;for now I am sure that none of these matters
will ever come to <!-- page 204--><a name="page204"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 204</span>further light, if you be
true.&rsquo;&nbsp; Bower answered, &lsquo;I protest before God I
shall be counted the most damnable traitor in the world, if any
man on earth know, for I have buried them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>After supper, Bower and Logan called Sprot out on to the open
hill-side.&nbsp; Logan said that Bower confessed to having shown
Sprot a letter of Gowrie&rsquo;s.&nbsp; What, he asked, did Sprot
think of the matter?&nbsp; Sprot, with protestations of loyalty,
said that he thought that Logan had been in the Gowrie
conspiracy.&nbsp; Logan then asked for an oath of secrecy,
promising &lsquo;to be the best sight you ever saw,&rsquo; and
taking out 12<i>l.</i> (Scots) bade Sprot buy corn for his
children.&nbsp; Asked who were present at the scene of the
supper, Sprot named eight yeomen.&nbsp; &lsquo;The lady&rsquo;
(Lady Restalrig) &lsquo;was also present at table that night, and
at her rising she said, &ldquo;The Devil delight in such a feast,
that will make all the children weep hereafter,&rdquo; and this
she spoke, as she went past the end of the table.&nbsp; And,
after entering the other chamber, she wept a while, &lsquo;and we
saw her going up and down the chamber weeping.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A fortnight later, Lady Restalrig blamed Bower for the selling
of Fastcastle.&nbsp; Bower appealed to Logan; it was
Logan&rsquo;s fault, not his.&nbsp; &lsquo;One of two
things,&rsquo; said Bower, &lsquo;must make you sell your lands;
either you think your children are bastards, or you have planned
some treason.&rsquo;&nbsp; The children were not those of Lady
Restalrig, but by former marriages.&nbsp; Logan replied,
&lsquo;If I had all the land between the <!-- page 205--><a
name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>Orient and
the Occident, I would sell the same, and, if I could not get
money for it, I would give it to good fellows.&rsquo;&nbsp; On
another occasion Logan said to Bower, &lsquo;I am for no land, I
told you before and will tell you again.&nbsp; You have not
learned the art of memory.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In fact, Logan did sell, not only Fastcastle, but Flemington
and Restalrig.&nbsp; We know how the Scot then clung to his
acres.&nbsp; Why did Logan sell all?&nbsp; It does not appear, as
we have shown, that he was in debt.&nbsp; If he had been, his
creditors would have had him &lsquo;put to the horn,&rsquo;
proclaimed a recalcitrant debtor, and the record thereof would be
found in the Privy Council Register.&nbsp; But there is no such
matter.&nbsp; Sprot supposed that Logan wished to turn his
estates into money, to be ready for flight, if the truth ever
came out.&nbsp; The haste to sell all his lands is certainly a
suspicious point against Logan.&nbsp; He kept on giving Sprot
money (hush money, and for forgeries to defraud others,
sometimes) and taking Sprot&rsquo;s oath of secrecy.</p>
<p>A remarkable anecdote follows; remarkable on this
account.&nbsp; In the letter (II) which Logan is said by Sprot to
have written to Bower (July 18, 1600) occurs the phrase,
&lsquo;Keep all things very secret, that my lord my brother get
no knowledge of our purposes, <i>for I rather be eirdit
quik</i>&rsquo;&mdash;would rather be buried alive (p.
184).&nbsp; This &lsquo;my lord my brother&rsquo; is obviously
meant for Alexander, sixth Lord Home, whose father, the fifth
lord, had married Agnes, sister of Patrick, sixth Lord Gray, and
widow of Sir Robert Logan of <!-- page 206--><a
name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
206</span>Restalrig.&nbsp; By Sir Robert, Lady Restalrig had a
son, the Logan of this affair; and, when, after Sir
Robert&rsquo;s death, she married the fifth Lord Home, she had to
him a son, Alexander, sixth Lord Home.&nbsp; Our Logan and the
sixth Lord Home were, therefore, brothers uterine. <a
name="citation206a"></a><a href="#footnote206a"
class="citation">[206a]</a></p>
<p>Now, if we accept as genuine (in substance) the one letter
which Sprot declared to be really written by Logan (No. IV),
Gowrie was anxious that Home, a person of great importance,
Warden on the Border, should be initiated into the
conspiracy.&nbsp; As Gowrie had been absent from Scotland,
between August 1594 (when he, as a lad, was in league with the
wild king-catcher, Francis Stewart of Bothwell), and May 1600, we
ask, what did Gowrie know of Home, and why did he think him an
useful recruit?&nbsp; The answer is that (as we showed in another
connection, p. 130) Gowrie was in Paris in February-April 1600,
that Home was also in Paris at the same time (arriving in
Scotland, at his house of Douglas, April 18, 1600), and that Home
did not go to Court, on his return, owing to the King&rsquo;s
displeasure because of his &lsquo;trysting with Bothwell&rsquo;
in Brussels. <a name="citation206b"></a><a href="#footnote206b"
class="citation">[206b]</a></p>
<p>Here then we have, in March 1600, Gowrie and Home, in Paris,
and Bothwell, the King-catcher, meeting Home in Brussels.&nbsp;
Therefore, when Letter IV represents Gowrie as anxious to bring
Home, <!-- page 207--><a name="page207"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 207</span>who had been consulting Bothwell,
into his plot, nothing can be more natural.&nbsp; Gowrie himself
conceivably met his old rebellious ally, Bothwell; he was certain
to meet Home in Paris, and Home, owning Douglas Castle and Home
Castle near the Border, would have been a most serviceable
assistant.&nbsp; It must also be remembered that Home was, at
heart, a Catholic, a recent and reluctant Protestant convert,
&lsquo;compelled to come in,&rsquo; by the Kirk.&nbsp; Bothwell
was a Catholic; Gowrie, he declared, was another; Logan was a
trafficker with Jesuits, and an &lsquo;idolater&rsquo; in the
matter of &lsquo;keeping great Yules.&rsquo;&nbsp; Logan,
however, if Letter IV is genuine, in substance, wrote that he
&lsquo;utterly dissented&rsquo; from Gowrie&rsquo;s
opinion.&nbsp; He would not try his brother&rsquo;s,
Home&rsquo;s, mind in the matter, or &lsquo;consent that he ever
should be counsellor thereto, for, in good faith, he will never
help his friend, nor harm his foe.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Such being the relations (if we accept Letter IV as in
substance genuine) between Gowrie, Home, and Logan, we can
appreciate Sprot&rsquo;s anecdote, now to be given, concerning
Lady Home.&nbsp; Logan, according to Sprot, said to him, in
Edinburgh, early in 1602, &lsquo;Thou rememberest what my Lady
Home said to me, when she would not suffer my lord to subscribe
my contract for Fentoun, because I would not allow two thousand
marks to be kept out of the security, and take her word for
them?&nbsp; She said to me, <i>which was a great knell to my
heart</i>, that since her coming to the town, she knew that I had
been in some dealing with <!-- page 208--><a
name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>the Earl of
Gowrie about Dirleton.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now Dirleton, according to
Sprot, was to have been Logan&rsquo;s payment from Gowrie, for
his aid in the plot.</p>
<p>Logan then asked Sprot if he had blabbed to Lady Home, but
Sprot replied that &lsquo;he had never spoken to her Ladyship but
that same day, although he had read the contract&rsquo; (as to
Fentoun) &lsquo;before him and her in the abbey,&rsquo; of
Coldingham, probably.&nbsp; Logan then requested Sprot to keep
out of Lady Home&rsquo;s sight, lest she should ask questions,
&lsquo;<i>for I had rather be eirdit quick than either my Lord or
she knew anything of it</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now, in Letter II (July 18, 1600), from Logan to Bower, Logan,
as we saw, is made to write, &lsquo;See that my Lord, my brother,
gets no knowledge of our purposes, <i>for I</i> (<i>sic</i>)
<i>rather be eirdit quik</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; The phrase recurs in
another of the forged letters not produced in court.</p>
<p>It is thus a probable inference that Logan did use this
expression to Sprot, in describing the conversation about Lady
Home, and that Sprot inserted it into his forged Letter II (Logan
to Bower).&nbsp; But, clever as Sprot was, he is scarcely likely
to have invented the conversation of Logan with Lady Home,
arising out of Logan&rsquo;s attempt to do some business with
Lord Home about Fentoun.&nbsp; A difficulty, raised by Lady Home,
led up to the lady&rsquo;s allusion to Dirleton, &lsquo;which was
a great knell to my heart,&rsquo; said Logan.&nbsp; This is one
of the passages which indicate a basis of truth in the
confessions of Sprot.&nbsp; Again, <!-- page 209--><a
name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 209</span>as Home and
Gowrie were in Paris together, while Bothwell was in Brussels, in
February 1600, and as Home certainly, and Gowrie conceivably, met
Bothwell, it may well have been that Gowrie heard of Logan from
Bothwell, the old ally of both, and marked him as a useful
hand.&nbsp; Moreover, he could not but have heard of
Logan&rsquo;s qualities and his keep, Fastcastle, in the troubles
and conspiracies of 1592&ndash;1594.&nbsp; After making these
depositions, Sprot attested them, with phrases of awful
solemnity, &lsquo;were I presently within one hour to
die.&rsquo;&nbsp; He especially insisted that he had written, to
Logan&rsquo;s dictation, the letter informing John Baillie of
Littlegill that all Gowrie&rsquo;s papers were burned.&nbsp; As
we saw, in November 1609, the King deliberately cleared Baillie
of all suspicion.&nbsp; There could be no evidence.&nbsp; Bower,
the messenger, was dead.</p>
<p>Baillie was now called.&nbsp; He denied on oath that he had
ever received the letter from Logan.&nbsp; He had never seen
Gowrie, &lsquo;except on the day he came first home, and rode up
the street of Edinburgh.&rsquo;&nbsp; Confronted with Baillie,
&lsquo;Sprot abides by his deposition.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Willie Crockett was then called.&nbsp; He had been at
Logan&rsquo;s &lsquo;great Yule&rsquo; in Gunnisgreen, where
Logan, according to Sprot, made the imprudent speeches.&nbsp;
Crockett had also been at Dundee with Logan, he said, but it was
in the summer of 1603.&nbsp; He did not hear Logan&rsquo;s
imprudent speech to Bower, at the Yule supper.&nbsp; As to the
weeping of Lady Restalrig, he had often seen her weep, and heard
her <!-- page 210--><a name="page210"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 210</span>declare that Logan would ruin his
family.&nbsp; He only remembered, as to the Yule supper, a
quarrel between Logan and Willie Home.</p>
<p>This was the only examination at which Archbishop Spottiswoode
attended.&nbsp; Neither he nor any of the Lords (as we have said
already) signed the record, which is attested only by James
Primrose, Clerk of Council, signing at the foot of each
page.&nbsp; Had the Lords &lsquo;quitted the diet&rsquo;?</p>
<p>The next examination was held on July 22, Dunfermline, Dunbar,
Sir Thomas Hamilton, the President of the Court of Session, and
other officials, all laymen, being present.&nbsp; Sprot
incidentally remarked that Logan visited London, in 1603, after
King James ascended the English throne.&nbsp; Logan appears to
have gone merely for pleasure; he had seen London before, in the
winter of 1586.&nbsp; On his return he said that he would
&lsquo;never bestow a groat on such vanities&rsquo; as the
celebration of the King&rsquo;s holiday, August 5, the
anniversary of the Gowrie tragedy; adding &lsquo;when the King
has cut off all the noblemen of the country he will live at
ease.&rsquo;&nbsp; But many citizens disliked the 5th of August
holiday as much as Logan did.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>In the autumn of 1605, Logan again visited London.&nbsp; In
Sprot&rsquo;s account of his revels there, and his bad reception,
we have either proof of Logan&rsquo;s guilt, if the tale be true,
or high testimony to Sprot&rsquo;s powers as an artist in
fiction.&nbsp; He says that Matthew Logan accompanied the Laird
to town in September 1605, and <!-- page 211--><a
name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span>in November
was sent back with letters to Bower.&nbsp; Eight days later,
Matthew took Sprot to Coldingham, to meet Bower, and get his
answer to the letters.&nbsp; It was a Sunday; these devotees
heard sermon, and then dined together at John
Corsar&rsquo;s.&nbsp; After dinner Bower took Sprot apart, and
showed him two letters.&nbsp; Would Sprot read to him the first
few words, that he might know which letter he had to
answer?&nbsp; The first letter shown (so Sprot writes on the
margin of his recorded deposition) referred to the money owed to
Logan, by the Earl of Dunbar, for Gunnisgreen and the lands of
Remington.&nbsp; Logan had expected to get the purchase money
from Dunbar in London; he never got more than 18,000 out of
33,000 marks.&nbsp; Sprot wrote for Bower the answer to this
business letter, and gave it to Matthew Logan to be sent to Logan
in London.&nbsp; Matthew, being interrogated, denied that he sent
any letter back to Logan, though he owned that Sprot wrote one;
and he denied that Sprot and Bower had any conference at all on
the occasion.&nbsp; But Sprot had asserted that the conference
with Bower occurred after Matthew Logan left them at
Corsar&rsquo;s house, where they dined, as Matthew admitted,
after sermon.&nbsp; Matthew denied too much.</p>
<p>A curious conference it was.&nbsp; Bower asked Sprot to read
to him the other of Logan&rsquo;s two letters, directed to
himself.&nbsp; It ran, &lsquo;Laird Bower,&mdash;I wot not what I
should say or think of this world!&nbsp; It is very hard to trust
in any man, for apparently there is no constancy or
faithfulness.&nbsp; For since I cam <!-- page 212--><a
name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 212</span>here they
whom I thought to have been my most entire friends have uttered
to me most injurie, and have given me the defiance, and say I am
not worthy to live, &ldquo;and if the King heard what has moved
you to put away all your lands, and <i>debosch</i> yourself, you
would not make such merryness, and play the companion in London,
as you do so near his Majestie.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Logan went on to express his fear that Bower&rsquo;s rash
speeches had roused these suspicions of &lsquo;the auld misterie
ye ken of.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;God forgive you, but I have had no
rest since these speeches were upcast to me.&rsquo;&nbsp; Bower
was to take great care of this letter, &lsquo;for it is within
three letters enclosed,&rsquo; and is confided to Matthew Logan
(who travelled by sea) as a trusty man.</p>
<p>Bower was much moved by this melancholy letter, and denied
that he had been gossiping.&nbsp; He had twice, before Logan rode
south, advised him to be very careful never even to mention the
name of Gowrie.</p>
<p>Sprot said that he, too, was uneasy, for, if anything came
out, he himself was in evil case.&nbsp; Logan visited France, as
well as London, at this time; he returned home in the spring of
1606, but Bower expressed the belief that he would go on to
Spain, &lsquo;to meet Bothwell and Father Andrew Clerk, and if he
come home it will be rather to die in his own country than for
any pleasure he has to live.&rsquo;&nbsp; Bothwell and Father
Andrew, of course, were both Catholic intriguers, among whom
Bothwell reckoned Logan and Gowrie.</p>
<p><!-- page 213--><a name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
213</span>Now the letter to Bower here attributed to Logan,
telling of the new &lsquo;knell at his heart&rsquo; when he is
rebuked and insulted as he plays the merry companion in London,
and near the Court; his touching complaint of the falseness of
the world (he himself being certainly the blackest of traitors),
with the distress of Bower, do make up a very natural
description.&nbsp; The ghost of his guilt haunts Logan, he cannot
drown it in a red sea of burgundy: life has lost its flavour; if
he returns, it will be with the true Scottish desire to die in
his own country, though of his ancient family&rsquo;s lands he
has not kept an acre.&nbsp; Pleasant rich Restalrig, strong
Fastcastle, jolly Gunnisgreen of the &lsquo;great Yules,&rsquo;
all are gone.&nbsp; Nothing is left.</p>
<p>Surely, if Sprot invented all this, he was a novelist born out
of due time.&nbsp; Either he told truth, or, in fiction, he
rivalled De Foe.</p>
<p>Matthew Logan, being called, contradicted Sprot, as we have
already said.&nbsp; He himself had seen Bower when he brought him
Logan&rsquo;s letter from London, take his son, Valentine, apart,
and knew that Valentine read a letter to him.&nbsp; &lsquo;It was
a meikle letter,&rsquo; Matthew said, and, if Sprot tell truth,
it contained three enclosures.&nbsp; Bower may have stopped his
son from reading the melancholy and compromising epistle, and
kept it to be read by Sprot.&nbsp; Logan&rsquo;s folly in writing
at all was the madness that has ruined so many men and women.</p>
<p>Matthew could not remember having ridden to <!-- page 214--><a
name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 214</span>Edinburgh
with Logan in July 1600, just before the Gowrie affair, as Sprot
had declared that he did.&nbsp; We could scarcely expect him to
remember that.&nbsp; He could remember nothing at all that was
compromising, nothing of Logan&rsquo;s rash speeches.&nbsp; As to
the Yule feast at Gunnisgreen, he averred that Lady Restalrig
only said, &lsquo;The Devil delight in such a feast that makes
discord, and makes the house ado&rsquo;&mdash;that is, gives
trouble.&nbsp; Asked if wine and beer were stored in Fastcastle,
in 1600, he said, as has already been stated, that a hogshead of
wine was therein.&nbsp; He himself, he said, had been &lsquo;in
the west,&rsquo; at the time of the Gowrie tragedy, and first
heard of it at Falkirk.</p>
<p>On August 6, Sprot was interrogated again.&nbsp; Only lay
lords were present: there were no clergymen nor lawyers.&nbsp; He
denied that he had received any promise of life or reward.&nbsp;
He asked to be confronted with Matthew Logan, and reported a
conversation between them, held when Lord Dunbar took possession
of Gunnisgreen.&nbsp; Matthew then hoped to ride with the Laird
to London (1605), but said, &lsquo;Alas, Geordie Sprot, what
shall we all do now, now nothing is left?&nbsp; I was aye feared
for it, for I know the Laird has done some evil turn, and he will
not bide in the country, and woe&rsquo;s me therefor.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sprot asked what the &lsquo;evil turn&rsquo; was.&nbsp;
Matthew answered, &lsquo;I know well enough, but, as the proverb
goes, &ldquo;what lies not in my way breaks not my
shins.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 215--><a name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
215</span>Sprot added that, after Bower&rsquo;s death (January
1606), Logan wrote to him from London, not having heard the news
of his decease.&nbsp; Lady Restalrig opened the letter and wrote
a postscript &lsquo;Give this to Laird Bower, for I trow that he
be ridden to Hell, as he ofttimes said to the Laird that he would
do.&rsquo;&nbsp; In Letter IV. Logan tells Gowrie that he
believes Bower &lsquo;would ride to Hell&rsquo;s gate to pleasure
him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sprot was now asked about two letters.&nbsp; One of these
(Logan to Chirnside) is endorsed, &lsquo;Production by Niniane
Chirnesyde.&nbsp; XIII April 1608.&rsquo;&nbsp; Another is Letter
V, endorsed &lsquo;produced by Ninian Chirnside,&rsquo; a fact
first noted by Mr. Anderson.&nbsp; Yet another is the letter in
twelve torn pieces.&nbsp; Logan, in the first of these three
letters, requests Chirnside to find a letter which Bower lost in
Dunglas.&nbsp; The letter imperils Logan&rsquo;s life and
lands.&nbsp; The date is September 23, and purports, falsely, to
be written before Logan goes to London (1605).&nbsp; Sprot
explained that he forged the letters, that Chirnside might
blackmail Logan&rsquo;s executors, and make them forgive him the
debts which (as Logan&rsquo;s will proves) he owed to the
estate.</p>
<p>Here we cite the letter of the twelve fragments.&nbsp; It is,
of course, a forgery by Sprot, to enable Chirnside to terrorise
his creditors, Logan&rsquo;s executors.&nbsp; But, as it directly
implicates Chirnside himself in the Gowrie conspiracy, probably
he disliked it, and tore it up.&nbsp; Yet the artist could not
part with his work; it still lies, now reconstructed, in the old
<!-- page 216--><a name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
216</span>folio sheet of paper.&nbsp; The reader will remark
that, like Letters I (?), III, and V, this torn letter is a mere
<i>pastiche</i> framed (as Sprot confessed) on ideas and
expressions in Letter IV.</p>

<p>On the same day (August 6) Sprot withdrew a deposition (made
before July 5) that the Unknown, for whom Letters I, III, V were
meant, was the Laird of Kinfauns, Sir Harry Lindsay, who, in
1603, tried to shoot Patrick Eviot, one of the Gowrie
fugitives.&nbsp; The Constable of Dundee (Sir James Scrymgeour)
Sprot had also accused falsely.&nbsp; The Letters (I (?), III,
V), he says, were &lsquo;imagined by me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>On August 8, three ministers, Patrick Galloway, John Hall, and
Peter Hewatt, were present.&nbsp; The two former were now
preachers of the courtly party, the third received a pension of
500 marks from the King, after the posthumous trial of Logan
(1609), at which the five letters were produced, but this reward
may have been a mere coincidence.&nbsp; The ministers Hall and
Hewatt, in August 1600, had at first, as we saw, declined to
accept James&rsquo;s version of the affair at Gowrie House (pp.
99&ndash;103).</p>
<p>Sprot now confesses that he knows he is to die, deposes that
no man has promised him life, and that he has stated nothing in
hope of life.&nbsp; With tears he deplores that he has taken
God&rsquo;s name in vain, in swearing to the truth of his
depositions before that of July 5.&nbsp; His last five
depositions under examination are &lsquo;true in all points and
circumstances, and he will go to the death with the
same.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 218--><a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
218</span>&lsquo;Further the said George Sprot remembers that in
the summertide of 1601, the Laird of Restalrig had indented with
the Lord Willoughby, then Governor of Berwick, concerning my
Lord&rsquo;s ship then built and lying at Berwick, whereof the
Laird should have been equal partner with my Lord, and to take
voyage with the said ship, either by the Laird himself, or some
other person whom it pleased him to appoint . . . to pass to the
Indies, the Canarys, and through the Straits, for such conditions
as were set down in the indenture betwixt my Lord and him, which
was framed by Sir John Guevara,&rsquo; Willoughby&rsquo;s cousin,
the kidnapper of Ashfield in 1599.</p>
<p>Now this ship of Lord Willoughby&rsquo;s, at all events, was a
real ship; and here is a grain of fact in the narrative of
Sprot.&nbsp; The ship was built by Lord Willoughby to protect
English commerce from the piracies of the Dunkirkers.&nbsp; On
March 28, 1601, he writes from Berwick to Cecil, &lsquo;The
respect of my country and the pity of those hurt by such&rsquo;
(the Dunkirkers) &lsquo;persuaded me to build a ship, and moves
me now to offer to serve her Majesty at as reasonable a rate as
any ship of 140 tons, with sixteen pieces of artillery, and 100
men can be maintained with. . . .&nbsp; If this offer seem good
to you and the Council, my ship shall presently be fitted, if not
I purpose to dispose otherwise of her&rsquo; (to Logan),
&lsquo;being not able to maintain her.&rsquo;&nbsp;
(&lsquo;Border Calendar,&rsquo; ii. 738).&nbsp; On April 19,
Willoughby wrote that he had pursued, <!-- page 219--><a
name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 219</span>with his
ship, a pirate which had carried an English prize into the
Forth.&nbsp; But he cannot, unaided, maintain the ship, even for
one summer.&nbsp; On June 14, Willoughby &lsquo;took a great
cold&rsquo; in his ship, lying at the haven mouth, awaiting a
wind, and died suddenly.&nbsp; On July 20, Carey says that his
body has been placed, with all honourable rites, on board his
ship.</p>
<p>It appears, then, that Willoughby, unable to maintain his
ship, and not subsidised by Government, in the summer of 1601
admitted Logan to a half of the venture, carrying great
expenses.&nbsp; Logan settled the business at Robert
Jackson&rsquo;s house, in Bridge Street, Berwick, being
accompanied by Sprot, Bower, and Matthew Logan.&nbsp; Matthew
said privately to Sprot, &lsquo;Wae&rsquo;s me that ever I should
see this day, that the Laird should grow a seaman!&nbsp; I wot
not what it means, for it is for no good, and I fear this shall
be one of the sorrowful blocks that ever the Laird made.&nbsp; It
is true that I have oft thought that the Laird would pass away,
for he is minded to sell all that he has, and would to God that
he had never been born, what should he do with such conditions,
to go or to send to the sea?&nbsp; He might have lived well
enough at home.&nbsp; I find he has ever been
<i>carried</i>&rsquo; (excited), &lsquo;and his mind has ever
been set on passing out of the country this year past,&rsquo;
that is since the Gowrie affair.</p>
<p>Now all this tale has much <i>vraisemblance</i>.&nbsp; The
facts about Logan&rsquo;s adventure with Willoughby, <!-- page
220--><a name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
220</span>stopped by Willoughby&rsquo;s death, were easily
verifiable.&nbsp; Logan, at his death, owned a ship, rated at 500
marks (so we read in his inventory), but this can hardly have
been the ship of Willoughby.&nbsp; He was restless, excited,
selling land to supply a maritime enterprise.</p>
<p>At this time Lady Restalrig was deeply distressed, she wished
Logan at the Indies, if only he would first settle Flemington on
herself.&nbsp; &lsquo;If it be God&rsquo;s will, I desire never
to have a child to him,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have a
guess what this mystery means, woe&rsquo;s me for his motherless
children,&rsquo; that is, children of former marriages.&nbsp;
Later, Lady Restalrig had a daughter, Anna, by Logan.</p>
<p>Matthew Logan, as usual, denied every word attributed to him
by Sprot, except regrets for his own condition.&nbsp; Matthew
could do no less to save his own life.</p>
<p>On August 9, before other witnesses, and the Rev. Messrs.
Galloway, Hall, and Hewatt, Sprot solemnly confessed to having
forged the letters in Logan&rsquo;s hand (then in possession of
his examiners).&nbsp; On August 10, the same clergymen and many
Lords, and Hart, being present, Sprot came to the point at
last.&nbsp; Where, he was asked, after a prayer offered, at his
request, by Mr. Galloway, <i>was the letter of Logan to
Gowrie</i>, <i>whereon</i>, <i>as model</i>, <i>the rest were
forged</i>?&nbsp; Now he had not previously mentioned, as far as
the reports go, a letter of Logan to Gowrie, as the model of his
forgeries.&nbsp; He had mentioned, as his model, the brief
harmless letter of Gowrie to Logan.&nbsp; On <!-- page 221--><a
name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 221</span>August 9,
he had been very solemnly told that he was to die, and that he
would see the faces of the Lords of the Council no more.&nbsp;
Probably, after they left him, he told, to a minister or a
servant in the gaol, the fact that he had used, as his model, a
letter from Logan to Gowrie.&nbsp; The result was that he did
again see, on August 10, the Lords of the Council, who asked him
&lsquo;where the letter now was.&rsquo;&nbsp; This is Letter IV,
the letter of Logan to Gowrie, of July 29, 1600.&nbsp; Sprot, in
place of answering directly, cited from memory, and erroneously,
the opening of the letter.&nbsp; He had read it, while it was
still unfinished, in July 1600, at Fastcastle.&nbsp; Logan, who
had been writing it, was called by Bower, went out, and thrust it
between a bench and the wall: there Sprot found, read, and
restored the unfinished epistle to its place.&nbsp; But the
letter is dated &lsquo;from Gunnisgreen,&rsquo; at the
conclusion.&nbsp; Logan, according to Sprot, left Gunnisgreen one
day at the end of July, 1600, or beginning of August, thence rode
to Fastcastle, and thence, next day, to Edinburgh (p. 190).</p>
<p>Now Logan, in the letter (IV), says that he took two days to
write it.&nbsp; One day would be at Fastcastle, when he was
interrupted; the other, the day of dating, at Gunnisgreen.&nbsp;
This, however, does not tally with Sprot&rsquo;s account (p. 190)
of Logan&rsquo;s movements (Nine Wells, Gunnisgreen, Fastcastle,
Edinburgh), if these are the days of writing Letter IV.&nbsp;
Yet, if Sprot forged Letter IV, he knew where he dated it from;
<a name="citation221"></a><a href="#footnote221"
class="citation">[221]</a> <!-- page 222--><a
name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 222</span>if the
Government had it forged, they knew, from Sprot&rsquo;s
confession, that it should have been dated from Fastcastle.&nbsp;
Perhaps we should not bear too heavily on this point.&nbsp; A man
may mention the wrong name by inadvertence, or the clerk, by
inadvertence, may write the wrong name.&nbsp; Mr. Mark Napier in
his essay on this matter twice or thrice prints
&lsquo;Logan&rsquo; for &lsquo;Sprot,&rsquo; or
&lsquo;Sprot&rsquo; for &lsquo;Logan.&rsquo; <a
name="citation222"></a><a href="#footnote222"
class="citation">[222]</a>&nbsp; &lsquo;Fastcastle,&rsquo; in
Sprot&rsquo;s confession, may be a slip of tongue or pen for
&lsquo;Gunnisgreen,&rsquo; or he may have been confused among the
movements to and from Gunnisgreen and Fastcastle.&nbsp; The
present writer finds similar errors in the manuscript of this
work.</p>
<p>Sprot next alleged that, three months after the Gowrie affair,
Logan bade Bower hunt among his papers for this very
letter.&nbsp; He had been at Berwick, with Lord Willoughby, and
Bower told Sprot that he was &lsquo;taking order&rsquo; with all
who knew of his part in the Gowrie plot.&nbsp; Here is the old
difficulty.&nbsp; Why was the letter kept for one moment after
Bower brought it back?&nbsp; Why leave it with Bower for three
months?&nbsp; At all events, as Bower could not read, Sprot
helped him to look for the letter, found it, and kept it
&lsquo;<i>till</i> he framed three new letters upon it,&rsquo;
after which he does not say what he did with it.</p>
<p>Here Sprot cited, from memory, but not accurately, more of
Letter IV.&nbsp; The existence of such errors is not
remarkable.&nbsp; Sprot again swore to the <!-- page 223--><a
name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 223</span>truth of
all his depositions since July 5.&nbsp; But if <i>this</i> story
is true, how can it be true that Logan was at ease in his mind,
after burning the letter from Alexander Ruthven, and another from
Father Andrew Clerk, Jesuit, as Sprot previously swore?&nbsp;
There was still Letter IV, lost, unburned, a haunting fear.&nbsp;
It may be suggested that Sprot only kept this letter
&lsquo;<i>till</i>&rsquo; he had made his forgeries on its model,
and then, in a later search, pretended to find and returned it,
having first copied it out in Logan&rsquo;s hand; that copy being
our Letter IV.&nbsp; Sprot first would make a copy, in his
ordinary hand, of the letter, then restore the original, and,
after Logan&rsquo;s death, copy his copy, in imitation of
Logan&rsquo;s hand, and frame I, III, V, and the torn letter on
his copy of IV.&nbsp; Finally, Sprot said that &lsquo;<i>he
believes</i> this letter is in his chest among his writings,
because he left it there when he was taken by Watty Doig and
deposes that it is closed and folded within a piece of
paper.&rsquo;&nbsp; Sprot said this on August 10.&nbsp; On August
12 he was hanged.&nbsp; Now was this letter, on which he forged
three others, found &lsquo;in his kist,&rsquo; before his
death?&nbsp; That it was so found, we have direct evidence,
though not from the best of sources.</p>
<p>In the year 1713, an aged nobleman, Lord Cromarty, published a
defence of the King&rsquo;s conduct in the Gowrie affair.&nbsp;
Lord Cromarty, in 1713, was aged eighty-three.&nbsp; Born about
1630, he remembered the beginnings of the Civil War, and says
that the Covenanters, about 1640&ndash;1645, made great <!-- page
224--><a name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
224</span>political capital out of King James&rsquo;s alleged
guilt in the slaughter of the Ruthvens.&nbsp; Later, Lord
Cromarty occupied, in the Restoration, the highest judicial
offices, and, as Clerk Registrar, had access to public
documents.&nbsp; He was an old courtier, he may have been
forgetful, he may have been unscrupulous, but, as to the letter
in Sprot&rsquo;s kist, he writes &lsquo;the letter was found
there by the Sheriff Depute, who was ordered by Sir William Hart,
Lord Justice of Scotland, to seize the said chest, and make
search for this letter, which he found, and delivered to the
King&rsquo;s Advocate, Sir Thomas Hamilton.&rsquo; <a
name="citation224"></a><a href="#footnote224"
class="citation">[224]</a></p>
<p>Now this Sir Thomas Hamilton was the ancestor of the Earl of
Haddington, who inherits many of his papers.&nbsp; Among these we
find a copy, in Sprot&rsquo;s &lsquo;course hand,&rsquo; or rapid
current hand, of Letter IV, and another of Letter I, but no such
copies of II, III. and V.&nbsp; Each of these is endorsed by
James Primrose, Clerk of Council, is endorsed by Sprot, in faded
ink, and is <i>also</i> endorsed in Sprot&rsquo;s ordinary
everyday hand, very firm and clear, thus:</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is copyitt off the principal&rsquo; (the
original), &lsquo;lykeas the note writtin upon the bak is writtin
by me, George Sprott.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There is, in fact, another &lsquo;note on the back,&rsquo; in
ink more faded, on a dirty rubbed part of the paper.</p>
<p>Now certainly the last endorsation was written by Sprot either
on August 11 or August 12, 1600.&nbsp; He had not the original or
this copy by him on <!-- page 225--><a name="page225"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 225</span>August 10, or on August 11 when
examined, for on August 10 he could only give a version of Letter
IV from memory, and erroneously, the version cited in his
indictment.&nbsp; On August 11 he still had not the original or
his copy, for he quoted from memory, what he believed to be a
<i>postscript</i> to the original Letter IV, a passage which is
really in the <i>text</i> of Letter IV.&nbsp; He could not have
made this error if, at that hour of August 11, he had either the
original of Letter IV, or his exact copy before him, nor would
there have been any reason why he should quote from memory, if
Government had the documents.&nbsp; Yet he re-endorsed his copies
of Letters I and IV before his death.&nbsp; This endorsement is
firm and clear, the text of the two copies is fainter and much of
the paper more rubbed, as if from being kept in the pocket.&nbsp;
The copies are older than the final endorsement on the
copies.&nbsp; It follows that the Sheriff Depute found these two
copies (I, IV) and the originals, in Sprot&rsquo;s kist, and
brought them to Sprot&rsquo;s examiners after that hour of August
11, when he could only quote from memory.&nbsp; He then endorsed
them formally, one of the last acts of his life.</p>
<p>The originals were also found, for it will not be argued that
Government employed another forger to forge them from
Sprot&rsquo;s copies in <!-- page 226--><a
name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
226</span>&lsquo;course hand.&rsquo;&nbsp; We know that Sprot had
a secondary species of blackmailing documents, these in current
hand; one of them he gave to the Goodman of Rentoun.&nbsp; For
this, or some other purpose, he had made the &lsquo;course
hand&rsquo; copies of Letters I and IV, which he endorsed just
before his death, or perhaps he made them from the original,
which he then destroyed or surreptitiously returned.&nbsp; When
he was examined on August 11, the three preachers, Galloway,
Hall, and Hewatt, and the minister of Duddingston, Mr. Lumisden,
were present.&nbsp; He was entreated not to perjure himself to
the injury of innocent people, dead or alive, &lsquo;by making
and forging of lies.&rsquo;&nbsp; He renewed his protestations of
truth, asked Mr. Galloway to pray for him, wept, and repeated his
averments.</p>
<p>On August 12 Sprot was tried and hanged at Edinburgh.&nbsp; He
renewed his protestations from every corner of the scaffold, in
the most vigorous language.&nbsp; Abbot, who was present,
declares that he thrice gave a loud clap with his hands while he
swung, as a proof that he adhered in death to his last
words.&nbsp; A similar story is told of Kirkcaldy of Grange, and
I think in other cases.&nbsp; Nothing of the sort is in the first
draft of the official account of his dying behaviour (a draft
manifestly drawn up near the spot), nor in the official account
itself.</p>
<p>Much value was set on dying confessions.&nbsp; When the
preacher, Robert Bruce, refused to believe the King&rsquo;s
account of the Gowrie tragedy, he said that one proof would
satisfy him.&nbsp; Let Andrew Henderson, the man in the turret,
be hanged.&nbsp; If he persisted in his confession on the
scaffold, Mr. Bruce would believe.&nbsp; The King declined to
make this <!-- page 227--><a name="page227"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 227</span>abominable experiment.&nbsp; In
Sprot&rsquo;s case his dying confession did not move the Kirk
party.&nbsp; Calderwood hints that Mr. Galloway &lsquo;had the
most speech to Sprot on the scaffold,&rsquo; and so kept him true
to a dying lie. <a name="citation227a"></a><a
href="#footnote227a" class="citation">[227a]</a>&nbsp; He adds
that Spottiswoode said to Galloway &lsquo;I am afraid this man
make us all ashamed,&rsquo; that is, by retracting his
confessions.&nbsp; Mr. Patrick answered, &lsquo;Let alone, my
Lord, I shall warrant him.&rsquo; <a name="citation227b"></a><a
href="#footnote227b" class="citation">[227b]</a>&nbsp; Had Andrew
Henderson swung, constant to his confession, the Presbyterian
sceptics would have found similar reasons for disbelief.</p>
<p>What are <i>we</i> to believe?&nbsp; Did Sprot go wherever he
went with a blasphemous lie in his mouth?&nbsp; A motive for such
vehemence of religious hypocrisy is difficult to find.&nbsp;
Conceivably he had promise of benefits to his family.&nbsp;
Conceivably he was an atheist, and &lsquo;took God in his own
hand.&rsquo;&nbsp; Conceivably his artistic temperament induced
him to act his lie well, as he had a lie to act.</p>
<p>Yet all this is not satisfactory.</p>
<p>Let us take the unromantic view of common sense.&nbsp; It is
this: Logan was a restless, disappointed intriguer and
debauchee.&nbsp; He sold his lands, some to acquire a partnership
with Lord Willoughby in a vessel trading to America; this vessel,
or another, is among his assets recorded in his inventory.&nbsp;
All his lands he sold&mdash;not that he was in debt, he was a
large lender&mdash;<!-- page 228--><a name="page228"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 228</span>for purposes of profligacy.&nbsp;
These proceedings gave rise to gossip.&nbsp; The Laird must be
selling his lands to evade forfeiture.&nbsp; He <i>must</i> have
been engaged in the Gowrie mystery.&nbsp; Then Logan dies (July
1606).&nbsp; Bower is also dead (January 1606).&nbsp; It occurs
to Sprot that there is money in all this, and, having lost
Logan&rsquo;s business, the hungry Sprot needs money.&nbsp; He
therefore makes a pact with some of Logan&rsquo;s debtors.&nbsp;
He, for pay, will clear them of their debts to Logan&rsquo;s
executors, whom he will enable them to blackmail.&nbsp;
Logan&rsquo;s descendants by two marriages were finally his
heirs, with Anna, a minor, daughter of his last wife, who had
hoped to have no children by him, the free-spoken Lady Restalrig,
<i>n&eacute;e</i> Ker (Marion).&nbsp; They, of course, were
robbed, by Logan&rsquo;s forfeiture, of 33,000 marks, owed to
Logan by Dunbar and Balmerino.&nbsp; Meanwhile, just after
Logan&rsquo;s death, in autumn 1606, Sprot forges Letters I, II,
III, IV, V, and the torn letter, with two compromising letters to
Bower, two to Ninian Chirnside, and an &lsquo;eik,&rsquo; or
addition, of compromising items to a memorandum on business,
which, in September 1605, Logan gave to Bower and John Bell
before he started for London and Paris.&nbsp; All these
documents, the plot-letters, I, II, III, IV, V, and the rest
(which lie before me), are mere instruments of blackmail,
intended to terrorise the guardians of the Logans.</p>
<p>So far, all is clear.&nbsp; But, in April 1608, Sprot has
blabbed and is arrested.&nbsp; The forgeries are found <!-- page
229--><a name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
229</span>among his papers, or given up by Chirnside.&nbsp; Sprot
confesses to the plot, to Logan&rsquo;s share of it, and to the
authenticity of the letters and papers.&nbsp; He is then
tortured, recants his confession, and avows the forgery of the
papers.&nbsp; The Government is disappointed.&nbsp; In July,
Dunbar comes down from town, treats Sprot leniently, and gives
him medical attendance.&nbsp; Sprot now confesses to his genuine
knowledge of the plot, but unflinchingly maintains that all the
papers so far produced are forgeries, based on facts.</p>
<p>Why does he do this?&nbsp; He has a better chance of pardon,
if he returns to the statement that they are genuine.&nbsp; If
they are, the Government, which he must propitiate, has a far
stronger hand, for the forgeries then defied detection.&nbsp;
However, for no conceivable reason, unless it be either
conscience or the vanity of the artist, Sprot now insists on
claiming the letters as his own handiwork.&nbsp; On this point he
was inaccessible to temptation, if temptation was offered.&nbsp;
If he lies as to Letter II having been dictated by Logan, he lies
by way of relapse into the habit of a lifetime, and so on other
points.&nbsp; He keeps back all mention of Letter IV, till the
last ember of hope of life is extinct.</p>
<p>It has not been hitherto known, either that Sprot kept back
Letter IV till almost his dying day, or that he then, at last,
revealed it.&nbsp; Lord Cromarty&rsquo;s averment that it was
found in Sprot&rsquo;s kist was disbelieved.&nbsp; It is true,
however, and now we ask, why did Sprot keep back Letter IV to the
last, and why, having so <!-- page 230--><a
name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 230</span>long
concealed it, did he say where it was, after all hope of life was
over?</p>
<p>The answer can only be conjectural.&nbsp; Some might guess
thus: till <!-- page 231--><a name="page231"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 231</span>Letter IV was confessed to and
found, Government had not received from Sprot one scrap of
documentary evidence that could be used against Logan&rsquo;s
heirs.&nbsp; Scoundrel as he was, Sprot could not guess that the
Privy Council would use papers which were confessed forgeries to
save Dunbar and Balmerino from paying some 33,000 marks to
Logan&rsquo;s executors.&nbsp; The wretched Sprot had robbed the
orphans on a small scale, but he would not, by producing the
genuine Logan letter, enable the Lords to ruin them
utterly.&nbsp; Bad as he was, the Laird had been kind to
Sprot.&nbsp; Therefore he kept back, and by many a lie concealed,
his real pieces of evidence, Letter IV, and I, if I is
genuine.&nbsp; So far he acted on a remnant of natural
conscience.</p>
<p>But Sprot, alas, had a religious conscience.&nbsp; He had a
soul to be saved.&nbsp; The preachers had prayed with him.&nbsp;
When death was but forty-eight hours distant, he feared to die
with a lie in his mouth.&nbsp; So <i>now</i>, at last, he spoke
of Letter IV as his real model.&nbsp; Perhaps he hoped that it
would not be found, and probably it was in some secret drawer or
false bottom of his kist.&nbsp; It was found, and was used, along
with the confessed forgeries (which even Sprot could not have
anticipated), to destroy the inheritance of the children, at
Logan&rsquo;s posthumous trial in 1609.</p>
<p>But the obvious reply to this hypothesis is, that Letter IV,
by the evidence of modern experts (evidence unanimous and
irresistible), is just as much forged as all the rest, is just as
certainly in Sprot&rsquo;s imitation of Logan&rsquo;s
handwriting.&nbsp; This being so, why did Sprot keep it back so
long, and why, having kept it back, did he, almost in his last
hour, produce it, and say (if he did) that it was genuine, and
his model, as it certainly was?&nbsp; This is the last enigma of
Sprot.&nbsp; His motives defy my poor efforts to decipher
them.&nbsp; Even if the substance of IV is genuine, what were
Sprot&rsquo;s motives?&nbsp; I do not feel assured that Sprot
really maintained the genuineness of the <i>handwriting</i> of
Letter IV.&nbsp; His remark that he kept Logan&rsquo;s letter
only <i>till</i> he forged others on it, as a model, certainly
implies that he did not keep it <i>after</i> he had done his
forgeries, and therefore that our Letter IV is, confessedly,
<i>not</i> Logan&rsquo;s original.&nbsp; Certainly it is not.</p>
<h2><!-- page 232--><a name="page232"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 232</span>XVI.&nbsp; WHAT IS LETTER IV?</h2>
<p>The crucial question now arises, <i>What is Letter
IV</i>?&nbsp; If it be genuine (in substance), then, whatever the
details of the Gowrie Conspiracy may have been, a conspiracy
there was.&nbsp; This can only be denied by ignorance.&nbsp; If
the enterprise fails, says the author of Letter IV, the plotters
will lose their lives, their lands and houses will be
&lsquo;wrecked,&rsquo; their very names will be extirpated; and,
in fact, James did threaten to extirpate the name of
Ruthven.&nbsp; The letter deliberately means High Treason.&nbsp;
The objection of Calderwood, and of all the Ruthven apologists,
that Sprot confessed to having forged <i>all</i> the letters, we
have shown to rest on lack of information.&nbsp; He said, at
last, that he had forged many papers (some did not appear in
Court in 1609), and that he forged <i>three</i> letters on the
model of Letter IV.&nbsp; These three letters may either be I,
III, and V; or III, V, and the torn letter.&nbsp; The case of
Letter I is peculiar.&nbsp; Though it contains much that is in
Letter IV, and might have been taken from it, the repetitions
need not imply copying from Letter IV.&nbsp; Byron and others
would say the same things, on the same day, to two <!-- page
233--><a name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 233</span>or
three correspondents.&nbsp; Letter IV is subsequent, as dated, to
Letter I, and Logan might say to the Unknown, on July 18, what,
after the announced interval of ten days, he said to
Gowrie.&nbsp; Letter I contains this remark on the nature of the
plot: &lsquo;It is not far by&rsquo; (not unlike) &lsquo;that
form, with the like stratagem, whereof we had conference in Cap.
h,&rsquo; which may be Capheaton, on the English side of the
Border.&nbsp; Probably Logan often discussed ingenious ways of
catching the King: new plots were hatched about once a month, as
Cecil&rsquo;s and the other correspondence of the age abundantly
proves.&nbsp; The plot (the letter says) is like that in a Paduan
story of a nobleman.&nbsp; The rest of the letter is identical
with the matter of III, IV, and V.&nbsp; We cannot be sure
whether Letter I is one of the three forged on IV or not.</p>
<p>One thing is certain, Letters III and V, to the Unknown,
<i>are</i> modelled on IV, as is the torn letter.&nbsp; Sprot
said this was the case, and every reader of III, V, and the torn
letter (given above) must see that he tells the truth.&nbsp;
These letters contain no invention at all, they merely repeat
Letter IV.&nbsp; Any man who could invent IV had genius enough to
alter his tunes in III, V. and the torn letter.&nbsp; But Sprot
never deserts his model.&nbsp; This is an argument for the
authenticity in substance of Letter IV.&nbsp; The other three
contain nothing that is not in Letter IV, and everything that is
in it, except what is personal to Gowrie, and would be
inappropriate if addressed to the Unknown (I, III, V), or to
Chirnside (torn letter).</p>
<p><!-- page 234--><a name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
234</span>There is (1) the mention of a Paduan adventure, the
basis of the plot, a thing that Sprot is very unlikely to have
invented.&nbsp; With all my admiration for Sprot, I do think that
the Paduan touch is beyond him.&nbsp; This occurs in Letter IV,
&lsquo;the good sport that M.A., your lordship&rsquo;s brother,
told me of a nobleman in Padua.&nbsp; It is a parasteur&rsquo; (?
<i>&agrave; propos</i>) &lsquo;to this purpose we have in
hand.&rsquo;&nbsp; This appears in Letter I, &lsquo;reckless toys
of Padua,&rsquo; and in Letter V, &lsquo;bid M. A. remember on
the sport he told me of Padua.&rsquo;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The constant applause of Bower.&nbsp; This is in
Letter IV, and in I, III, V, and the torn letter.</p>

and in I and V.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; The meeting at Fastcastle, which is to be quiet and

<p>5.&nbsp; Lord Home and Mr. Rhynd are to know nothing.&nbsp;
This is in IV, and in I, and V, and the torn letter, utterly
needless repetition.</p>

plot.&nbsp; This is in IV, and in I, but that is natural.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; Directions as to returning the letters.&nbsp; These

<p>9.&nbsp; Logan will be true, &lsquo;although the scaffold were
already set up.&rsquo;&nbsp; This is a phrase of Letter IV, and
recurs in Letter III and in the torn letter.</p>
<p>10.&nbsp; Logan&rsquo;s elevation of heart on receipt of
Gowrie&rsquo;s letter.&nbsp; This occurs in IV and in V.</p>
<p><!-- page 235--><a name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
235</span>Who can doubt that Letter IV is the source, followed
servilely by the forger, of the torn letter and I (?), III,
V?&nbsp; If Sprot could invent the substance of IV, why was he so
chary of invention in all the other letters?</p>
<p>It is clear, moreover, that the Unknown himself is derived
from a line in Letter IV: &lsquo;I have already sent another
letter to the gentleman your Lordship knows, as the bearer will
inform you of his answer.&rsquo;&nbsp; The bearer is always
Bower, so the &lsquo;gentleman&rsquo; is to be conceived as in
Gowrie&rsquo;s neighbourhood, or on the route thither, as one
bearer serves both for Gowrie and the gentleman.&nbsp; Therefore,
before July 5, Sprot (who had no idea as to who the gentleman
was) identified the &lsquo;gentleman,&rsquo; the Unknown of I,
III, V, with the laird of Kinfauns, near Perth, or with the
Constable of Dundee; but he withdrew these imputations, craving
the pardon of the accused.</p>
<p>Thus it stands to reason that I (?), III, V, and the torn
letter are forged on the model of IV.&nbsp; Sprot introduces no
novelties in I, III, V, or the torn epistle.&nbsp; He harps
eternally on the strings of IV.&nbsp; The only variation is (V)
the mention of &lsquo;one other man with you,&rsquo; in the
proposed sail to Fastcastle.</p>
<p>It is not easy for criticism to evade the conclusion that I
(?), III, V, and the torn letter are, indeed, forgeries modelled
on IV.&nbsp; And what is IV?</p>
<p>Is Letter IV in substance genuine?&nbsp; If not, why did Sprot
keep it back till the rope was noosed for <!-- page 236--><a
name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 236</span>his
neck?&nbsp; A guess at his possible reasons for so keeping it
back (as the only real documentary evidence extant against the
orphans of Logan) we have given, but this fails if Letter IV was
a forgery: as in handwriting it was.</p>
<p>Then there are the contents of Letter IV.&nbsp; To myself, and
to Mr. Anderson, it does not seem probable, it seems hardly
credible, that Sprot could have <i>invented</i> the contents of
Letter IV.&nbsp; If he did, his power of rendering character
might have been envied by the author of the Waverley
Novels.&nbsp; In IV Logan is painted, the &lsquo;main loose man,
but a good fellow,&rsquo; with a master hand.&nbsp; The thing is
freely, largely, and spontaneously executed.&nbsp; What
especially moves me to think IV no invention, is the reference to
the Paduan incident or romance, &lsquo;the good sport that Mr.
Alexander told me of the nobleman of Padua, it is <i>&agrave;
propos</i> to the purpose we have in hand.&rsquo;&nbsp; This is
casually inserted in the last words of the postscript, not
blazoned in the text, as in the forgeries confessedly modelled on
this letter.&nbsp; The whole tone of the letter is in keeping
with the alleged author&rsquo;s temperament.&nbsp; It is
respectful, but far from servile.&nbsp; Gowrie is a great Earl,
but Logan is of an old and good name.&nbsp; There is the genial
sensualism of the man, with his promise of wine and &lsquo;a fine
hattit kit&rsquo; (a kind of syllabub).&nbsp; There is the joyous
forward glance at an anniversary dinner, with Bothwell, to which
the King&rsquo;s hunting of <i>this</i> year shall furnish the
dainty cheer; &lsquo;<i>hoc jocose</i>!&rsquo;&nbsp; At this
dinner <!-- page 237--><a name="page237"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 237</span>Bothwell and Gowrie, old allies, are
to meet at Logan&rsquo;s board, which may suggest that Bothwell
and Gowrie are still working together.</p>
<p>The contempt for Lord Home as a conspirator&mdash;&lsquo;in
good faith he will never help his friend or harm his
foe&rsquo;&mdash;and the praises of Bower, are characteristic,
and, here, are in place; elsewhere they are idle repetitions,
mere copies.&nbsp; The apology for bad writing&mdash;Logan could
not employ a secretary in this case&mdash;is natural: the two
days writing agrees with Sprot&rsquo;s evidence. (p. 221.)</p>
<p>Could Sprot have invented all this: and, in his confessed
forgeries, failed to invent anything?&nbsp; Would not the
fertility of his genius have hurried him into fresh developments,
and characteristic details, appropriate to the imaginary
correspondent whom he addresses?&nbsp; These considerations may
seem a mere leaning on &lsquo;internal evidence,&rsquo; and
&lsquo;literary instinct,&rsquo; broken reeds.&nbsp; But the case
is buttressed by the long and, on any theory, purposeless
retention of Letter IV, the secrecy concerning it, and the
confession, so obviously true, that Letter IV is the source and
model of the forgeries.&nbsp; These facts have hitherto been
unknown to writers who believed the whole correspondence to be a
forgery done for the Government.</p>
<p>Both Mr. Anderson (who has greatly aided me by his acuteness
and learned experience of old MSS.) and myself disbelieve that
Logan&rsquo;s hand wrote Letter IV.&nbsp; The matter, the
contents of Letter IV, may be <!-- page 238--><a
name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
238</span>Logan&rsquo;s, but the existing document may be
&lsquo;a Sprot after Logan.&rsquo;&nbsp; Sprot may have
reinserted the genuine Logan IV among Bower&rsquo;s collection of
papers, pretended to find it, and returned it to Logan, after
copying it <i>in Logan&rsquo;s hand</i>.&nbsp; Or he may have
copied it in his &lsquo;course hand&rsquo; (the copy in the
Haddington MSS.), and later, in autumn 1606, after Logan&rsquo;s
death, have rewritten his copy in an imitation of Logan&rsquo;s
hand.&nbsp; The contents, Mr. Anderson believes, as I do, are,
none the less, genuine Logan.</p>
<p>If readers accept these conclusions, there was a Gowrie
conspiracy, and Logan was in it.&nbsp; &lsquo;I trow your
Lordship has a proof of my constancy already ere now,&rsquo; he
says in Letter IV, and Gowrie may have had a proof, in his early
conspiracies of 1593&ndash;1594, or in a testimonial to Logan
from Bothwell, Gowrie&rsquo;s old ally.</p>
<p>But, if readers do not accept our conclusions, they may still
rest, perhaps, on the arguments adduced in the earlier chapters
of this essay, to demonstrate that neither accident nor the
machinations of the King, but an enterprise of their own, caused
the Slaughter of the Ruthvens.&nbsp; The infamous conduct of the
Privy Council in 1608&ndash;1609 does not prove that, in 1600,
the King carried out a conspiracy in itself impossible.</p>
<p>I have found nothing tending to show that King James was ever
made aware of Sprot&rsquo;s confessions of forgery.&nbsp; It is
true that Sir William Hart, the Lord Justice, went to Court after
Sprot&rsquo;s death, and, in <!-- page 239--><a
name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 239</span>September,
the Scottish Privy Council asked James to send him home again. <a
name="citation239"></a><a href="#footnote239"
class="citation">[239]</a>&nbsp; But Hart need not have told all
the truth to James.</p>
<p>There is a kind of rejoicing <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i> in all
of James&rsquo;s references to the Gowrie affair, which seems to
me hardly consistent with his disbelief in his own prowess on
that occasion.&nbsp; If one may conjecture, one would guess that
the Privy Council and the four preachers managed to persuade
themselves, Sprot being the liar whom we know, that he lied when
he called his Logan papers forgeries.&nbsp; The real facts may
have been concealed from the King.&nbsp; Mr. Gunton, the
Librarian at Hatfield, informs me that, had he not seen Letter IV
(which he is sure was <i>written</i> by Sprot), he does not think
he should have suspected the genuineness of Letters II and III,
after comparing them with the undoubted letters of Logan in the
Cecil manuscripts.&nbsp; The Government and the four preachers,
with such documents in their hands, documents still apt to
delude, may easily have brought themselves to disbelieve
Sprot&rsquo;s assertion that they were all forgeries.&nbsp; Let
us hope that they did!</p>
<h2><!-- page 240--><a name="page240"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 240</span>XVII.&nbsp; INFERENCES AS TO THE
CASKET LETTERS</h2>
<p>The affair of Sprot has an obvious bearing on that other
mystery, the authenticity of the Casket Letters attributed to
Queen Mary.&nbsp; As we know, she, though accused, was never
allowed to see the letters alleged to be hers.&nbsp; We know
that, in December 1568, these documents were laid before an
assembly of English nobles at Hampton Court.&nbsp; They were
compared, for orthography and handwriting, with genuine letters
written by the Queen to Elizabeth, and Cecil tells us that
&lsquo;no difference was found.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was a rapid
examination, by many persons, on a brief winter day, partly
occupied by other business.&nbsp; If experts existed, we are not
informed that they were present.&nbsp; The Casket Letters have
disappeared since the death of the elder Gowrie, in 1584.&nbsp;
From him, Elizabeth had vainly sought to purchase them.&nbsp;
They were indispensable, said Bowes, her ambassador, to
&lsquo;the secrecy of the cause.&rsquo;&nbsp; Gowrie would not be
tempted, and it is not improbable that he carried so valuable a
treasure with him, when, in April 1584, he retired to Dundee, to
escape by sea if the Angus conspiracy failed.</p>
<p><!-- page 241--><a name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
241</span>At Dundee he was captured, after defending the house in
which he was residing.&nbsp; That house was pulled down recently;
nothing was discovered.&nbsp; But fable runs that, at the
destruction of another ancient house in Dundee, &lsquo;Lady
Wark&rsquo;s Stairs,&rsquo; <i>a packet of old letters in
French</i> was found in a hiding hole contrived within a
chimney.&nbsp; The letters were not examined by any competent
person, and nobody knows what became of them.&nbsp; Romance
relates that they were the Casket Letters, entrusted by Gowrie to
a friend.&nbsp; It is equally probable that he yielded them to
the King, when he procured his remission for the Raid of
Ruthven.&nbsp; In any case, they are lost.</p>
<p>Consequently we cannot compare the Casket Letters with genuine
letters by Mary.&nbsp; On the other hand, as I chanced to notice
that genuine letters of Logan&rsquo;s exist at Hatfield, I was
enabled, by the kindness of the Marquis of Salisbury, and of Sir
Stair Agnew, to have both the Hatfield Logan letters, and the
alleged Logan letters produced in 1609, photographed and
compared, at Hatfield and at the General Register House in
Edinburgh.&nbsp; By good fortune, the Earl of Haddington also
possesses (what we could not expect to find in the case of the
Casket Letters) documents in the ordinary handwriting of George
Sprot, the confessed forger of the plot-letters attributed to
Logan.&nbsp; The result of comparison has been to convince Mr.
Gunton at Hatfield, Mr. Anderson in Edinburgh, Professor Hume
Brown, and other gentlemen of experience, that Sprot forged all
the <!-- page 242--><a name="page242"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 242</span>plot-letters.&nbsp; Their reasons
for holding this opinion entirely satisfy me, and have been drawn
up by Mr. Anderson, in a convincing report.&nbsp; To put the
matter briefly, the forged letters present the marked
peculiarities of Logan&rsquo;s orthography, noted by the
witnesses in 1609.&nbsp; But they also contain many peculiarities
of spelling which are not Logan&rsquo;s, but are
Sprot&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The very dotting of the
&lsquo;i&rsquo;s&rsquo; is Sprot&rsquo;s, not
Logan&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The long &lsquo;s&rsquo; of Logan is heavily
and clumsily imitated.&nbsp; There is a distinct set of
peculiarities never found in Logan&rsquo;s undisputed letters: in
Sprot&rsquo;s own letters always found.&nbsp; The hand is more
rapid and flowing than that of Logan.&nbsp; Not being myself
familiar with the Scottish handwriting of the period, my own
opinion is of no weight, but I conceive that the general effect
of Logan&rsquo;s hand, in 1586, is not precisely like that of the
plot-letters.</p>
<p>My point, however, is that, in 1609, Sprot&rsquo;s forgeries
were clever enough to baffle witnesses of unblemished honour,
very familiar with the genuine handwriting of Logan.&nbsp; The
Rev. Alexander Watson, minister of the Kirk of Coldinghame (where
Logan was wont to attend), alleged that &lsquo;<i>the character
of every letter</i> resembles perfectly Robert&rsquo;s handwrit,
<i>every way</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; The spelling, which was peculiar,
was also Logan&rsquo;s as a rule.&nbsp; Mr. Watson produced three
genuine letters by Logan, before the Lords of the Articles (who
were very sceptical), and satisfied them that the plot-letters
were the laird&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Mr. Alexander Smith, minister of
Chirnside, was tutor to Logan&rsquo;s younger <!-- page 243--><a
name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 243</span>children;
he gave identical evidence.&nbsp; Sir John Arnott, Provost of
Edinburgh, a man of distinction and eminence, produced four
genuine letters by the Laird, &lsquo;agreeing perfectly in
spelling and character with the plot-letters.&nbsp; The sheriff
clerk of Berwick, William Home, in Aytoun Mill (a guest, I think,
at Logan&rsquo;s &lsquo;great Yules&rsquo;), and John Home,
notary in Eyemouth, coincided.&nbsp; The minister of Aytoun, Mr.
William Hogg, produced a letter of Logan to the Laird of Aytoun,
but was not absolutely so certain as the other witnesses.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He thinks them&rsquo; (the plot-letters) &lsquo;like [to
be] his writing, and that the same appear to be very like his
write, by the conformity of letters and spelling.&rsquo; <a
name="citation243a"></a><a href="#footnote243a"
class="citation">[243a]</a></p>
<p>Thus, at the examination of Logan&rsquo;s real and forged
letters, as at the examination of Queen Mary&rsquo;s real and
Casket letters, in spelling and handwriting &lsquo;no difference
was found.&rsquo;&nbsp; Yet the plot-letters were all forged, and
Mr. Anderson shows that, though &lsquo;no difference was
<i>found</i>,&rsquo; many differences existed.&nbsp; Logan had a
better chance of acquittal than Mary.&nbsp; The Lords of the
Articles, writes Sir Thomas Hamilton to the King (June 21, 1609),
&lsquo;had preconceived hard opinions of Restalrig&rsquo;s
process.&rsquo; <a name="citation243b"></a><a
href="#footnote243b" class="citation">[243b]</a>&nbsp; Yet they
were convinced by the evidence of the witnesses, and by their own
eyes.</p>
<p>From the error of the Lords of the Articles, in 1609, it
obviously follows that the English Lords, at Hampton Court, in
1568, may have been unable to <!-- page 244--><a
name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 244</span>detect
proofs of forgery in the Casket Letters, which, if the Casket
Letters could now be compared with those of Mary, would be at
once discovered by modern experts.&nbsp; In short, the evidence
as to Mary&rsquo;s handwriting, even if as unanimously accepted,
by the English Lords, as Cecil declares, is not worth a
&lsquo;hardhead,&rsquo; a debased copper Scottish coin.&nbsp; It
is worth no more than the opinion of the Lords of the Articles in
the case of the letters attributed to Restalrig.</p>

<h3>APPENDIX A.&nbsp; THE FRONTISPIECE</h3>
<p><i>Gowrie&rsquo;s Arms and Ambitions</i></p>
<p>The frontispiece of this volume is copied from the design of
the Earl of Gowrie&rsquo;s arms, in what is called
&lsquo;Workman&rsquo;s MS.,&rsquo; at the Lyon&rsquo;s office in
Edinburgh.&nbsp; The shield displays, within the royal treasure,
the arms of Ruthven in the first and fourth, those of Cameron and
Halyburton in the second and third quarters.&nbsp; The supporters
are, dexter, a Goat; sinister, a Ram; the crest is a Ram&rsquo;s
head.&nbsp; The motto is not given; it was <span
class="smcap">Deid Schaw</span>.&nbsp; The shield is blotted by
transverse strokes of the pen, the whole rude design having been
made for the purpose of being thus scored out, after
Gowrie&rsquo;s death, posthumous trial and forfeiture, in
1600.</p>
<p>On the left of the sinister supporter is an armed man, in the
Gowrie livery.&nbsp; His left hand grasps his sword-hilt, his
right is raised to an imperial crown, hanging above him in the
air; from his lips issue the words, <span class="smcap">Tibi
Soli</span>, &lsquo;for thee alone.&rsquo;&nbsp; Sir James
Balfour Paul, Lyon, informs me that he knows no other case of
such additional supporter, or whatever the figure ought to be
called.</p>
<p>This figure does not occur on any known Ruthven seal.&nbsp; It
is not on that of the first Earl of Gowrie, affixed to a deed of
February 1583&ndash;1584.&nbsp; It is not on a seal used <!--
page 246--><a name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
246</span>in 1597, by John, third Earl, given in Henry
Laing&rsquo;s &lsquo;Catalogue of Scottish Seals&rsquo; (vol. i.
under &lsquo;Ruthven&rsquo;).&nbsp; But, in Crawford&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Peerage of Scotland&rsquo; (1716), p. 166, the writer
gives the arms of the third Earl (John, the victim of August 5,
1600).&nbsp; In place of the traditional Scottish motto <i>Deid
Schaw</i>, is the Latin translation, <i>Facta Probant</i>.&nbsp;
The writer says (Note C), &lsquo;This from an authentic copy of
his arms, <i>richly illuminated in the year</i> 1597, with his
name and titles, <i>viz.</i> &ldquo;Joannes Ruthven, Comes de
Gowry, Dominus de Ruthven,&rdquo; &amp;c., in my
hands.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In 1597, as the archives of the Faculty of Law, in the
University of Padua, show, Gowrie was a student of Padua.&nbsp;
It is also probable that, in 1597, he attained his
majority.&nbsp; He certainly had his arms richly illuminated, and
he added to his ancestral bearings what Crawfurd describes thus:
&lsquo;On the dexter a chivaleer, garnish&rsquo;d with the
Earl&rsquo;s coat of arms, <i>pointing with a sword upward to an
imperial crown</i>, with this device, <span class="smcap">Tibi
Soli</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In Workman&rsquo;s MS., the figure points to the crown with
the open right hand, and the left hand is on the
sword-hilt.&nbsp; The illuminated copy of 1597, once in the
possession of Crawfurd, must be the more authentic; the figure
<i>here</i> points the sword at a crown, which is <i>Tibi
Soli</i>, &lsquo;For thee&rsquo; (Gowrie?)
&lsquo;alone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now on no known Ruthven seal, as we saw, does this figure
appear, not even on a seal of Gowrie himself, used in 1597.&nbsp;
Thus it is perhaps not too daring to suppose that Gowrie, when in
Italy in 1597, added this emblematic figure to his ancestral
bearings.&nbsp; What does the figure symbolise?</p>
<p>On this point we have a very curious piece of evidence.&nbsp;
On June 22, 1609, Ottavio Baldi wrote, from Venice, to James, now
King of England.&nbsp; His letter was forwarded by Sir Henry
Wotton.&nbsp; Baldi says that he has received from Sir Robert
Douglas, and is sending to the King by <!-- page 247--><a
name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 247</span>his
nephew&mdash;a Cambridge student&mdash;&lsquo;a strange relique
out of this country.&rsquo;&nbsp; He obtained it thus: Sir Robert
Douglas, while at home in Scotland, had &lsquo;heard
speech&rsquo; of &lsquo;a certain emblem or impresa,&rsquo; left
by Gowrie in Padua.&nbsp; Meeting a Scot in Padua, Douglas asked
where this emblem now was, and he was directed to the school of a
teacher of dancing.&nbsp; There the emblem hung, &lsquo;among
other devices and remembrances of his scholars.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Douglas had a copy of the emblem made; and immediately
&lsquo;acquainted me with the quality of the thing,&rsquo; says
Baldi.&nbsp; &lsquo;We agreed together, that it should be fit, if
possible, to obtain the very original itself, and to leave in the
room thereof the copy that he had already taken, which he did
effect by well handling the matter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thus hath your Majesty now a view, <i>in umbra</i>, of
those detestable thoughts which afterwards appeared <i>in
facto</i>, according to the said Earl&rsquo;s own
<i>mot</i>.&nbsp; For what other sense or allusion can the
reaching at a crown with a sword in a stretched posture, and the
impersonating of his device in a blackamore, yield to any
intelligent and honest beholder?&rsquo; <a
name="citation247"></a><a href="#footnote247"
class="citation">[247]</a></p>
<p>From Baldi&rsquo;s letter we learn that, in the device left by
Gowrie at Padua, the figure pointing a sword at the crown was a
negro, thus varying from the figure in Workman&rsquo;s MS., and
that in the illuminated copy emblazoned in 1597, and possessed in
1716 by Crawfurd.&nbsp; Next, we learn that Sir Robert Douglas
had heard talk of this emblem in Scotland, before he left for
Italy.&nbsp; Lastly, a <i>mot</i> on the subject by the Earl
himself was reported, to the effect that the device set forth
&lsquo;in a shadow,&rsquo; what was intended to be executed
&lsquo;in very deed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now how could Sir Robert Douglas, in Scotland, hear talk of
what had been done and said years ago by Gowrie in Padua?&nbsp;
Sir Robert Douglas was descended from <!-- page 248--><a
name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 248</span>Archibald
Douglas of Glenbervie (<i>ob.</i> 1570), who was ancestor of the
Catholic Earl of Angus (<i>flor.</i> 1596).&nbsp; This Archibald
of Glenbervie had a son, Archibald, named in his father&rsquo;s
testament, but otherwise unknown. <a name="citation248"></a><a
href="#footnote248" class="citation">[248]</a>&nbsp; Rather
senior to Gowrie at the University of Padua, and in the same
faculty of law, was an Archibald Douglas.&nbsp; He may have been
a kinsman of Sir Robert Douglas, himself of the Glenbervie
family, and from him Sir Robert, while still in Scotland, may
have heard of Gowrie&rsquo;s device, left by him at Padua, and of
his <i>mot</i> about <i>in umbra</i> and <i>in facto</i>.&nbsp;
But, even if these two Douglases were not akin, or did not meet,
still Keith, Lindsay, and Ker of Newbattle, all contemporaries of
Gowrie at Padua, might bring home the report of Gowrie&rsquo;s
enigmatic device, and of his <i>mot</i> there-anent.&nbsp; Had
the emblem been part of the regular arms of Ruthven, Sir Robert
Douglas, and every Scot of quality, would have known all about
it, and seen no mystery in it.</p>
<p>It will scarcely be denied that the assumption by Gowrie of
the figure in his livery, pointing a sword at the crown, and
exclaiming &lsquo;For Thee Only,&rsquo; does suggest that wildly
ambitious notions were in the young man&rsquo;s mind.&nbsp; What
other sense can the emblem bear?&nbsp; How can such ideas be
explained?</p>
<p>In an anonymous and dateless MS. cited in &lsquo;The Life of
John Earl of Gowrie,&rsquo; by the Rev. John Scott of Perth
(1818), it is alleged that Elizabeth, in April 1600, granted to
Gowrie, then in London, the guard and honours appropriate to a
Prince of Wales.&nbsp; The same Mr. Scott suggests a Royal
pedigree for Gowrie.&nbsp; His mother, wife of William, first
Earl, was Dorothea Stewart, described in a list of Scottish
nobles (1592) as &lsquo;sister of umquhile Lord
Methven.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now Henry Stewart, Lord Methven
(&lsquo;Lord Muffin,&rsquo; as Henry VIII used to call him), was
the third husband of the sister of Henry VIII, Margaret Tudor,
wife, <!-- page 249--><a name="page249"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 249</span>first of James IV, then of the Earl
of Angus (by whom she had Margaret, Countess of Lennox, and
grandmother of James VI), then of Lord Methven.&nbsp; Now if
Margaret Tudor had issue by Henry Stewart, Lord Methven, and if
that issue was Dorothea, mother of John, third Earl of Gowrie, or
was Dorothea&rsquo;s father or mother, that Earl was
Elizabeth&rsquo;s cousin.&nbsp; Now Burnet, touching on the
Gowrie mystery, says that his own father had &lsquo;taken great
pains to inquire into that matter, and did always believe it was
a real conspiracy. . . .&nbsp; Upon the King&rsquo;s death,
Gowrie stood next to the succession of the crown of
England,&rsquo; namely, as descended from Margaret Tudor by Henry
(Burnet says &lsquo;Francis&rsquo;!), Lord Methven.&nbsp;
Margaret and Methven, says Burnet, had a son, &lsquo;made Lord
Methven by James V.&nbsp; In the patent he is called <i>frater
noster uterinus</i>&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Our brother
uterine.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>He</i> had only a daughter, who
was mother or grandmother to the Earl of Gowrie, so that by this
he might be glad to put the King out of the way, that so he might
stand next to the succession of the crown of England.&rsquo; <a
name="citation249"></a><a href="#footnote249"
class="citation">[249]</a>&nbsp; If this were true, the meaning
of Gowrie&rsquo;s device would be flagrantly conspicuous.&nbsp;
But where is that patent of James V?&nbsp; Burnet conceivably
speaks of it on the information of his father, who &lsquo;took
great pains to inquire into the particulars of that
matter,&rsquo; so that he could tell his son, &lsquo;one thing
which none of the historians have taken any notice of,&rsquo;
namely, our Gowrie&rsquo;s Tudor descent, and his claims (failing
James <i>and his issue</i>) to the crown of England.&nbsp; Now
Burnet&rsquo;s father was almost a contemporary of the Gowrie
affair.&nbsp; Of the preachers of that period, the King&rsquo;s
enemies, Burnet&rsquo;s father knew Mr. Davidson (<i>ob.</i>
1603) and Mr. Robert Bruce, and had listened to their
prophecies.&nbsp; &lsquo;He told me,&rsquo; says Burnet,
&lsquo;of many of their predictions that he himself heard them
throw out, which had no effect.&rsquo;&nbsp; Davidson was an old
man in <!-- page 250--><a name="page250"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 250</span>1600; Bruce, for his disbelief in
James&rsquo;s account of the conspiracy, was suspended in that
year, though he lived till 1631, and, doubtless, prophesied in
select circles.&nbsp; Mr. Bruce long lay concealed in the house
of Burnet&rsquo;s great-grandmother, daughter of Sir John Arnot,
a witness in the trial of Logan of Restalrig.&nbsp; Thus
Burnet&rsquo;s father had every means of knowing the belief of
the contemporaries of Gowrie, and he may conceivably be
Burnet&rsquo;s source for the tale of Gowrie&rsquo;s Tudor
descent and Royal claims.&nbsp; They were almost or rather quite
baseless, but they were current.</p>
<p>In fact, Dorothea Stewart, mother of Gowrie, was certainly a
daughter of Henry Stewart, Lord Methven, and of Janet Stewart, of
the House of Atholl.&nbsp; We find no trace of issue born to
Margaret Tudor by her third husband, Lord Methven.&nbsp; Yet
Gowrie&rsquo;s emblem, adopted by him at Padua in 1597, and his
device left in the Paduan dancing school, do distinctly point to
some wild idea of his that some crown or other was &lsquo;for him
alone.&rsquo;&nbsp; At the trial of Gowrie&rsquo;s father, in
1584, we find mention of his &lsquo;challenginge that honor to be
of his Hignes blud,&rsquo; but <i>that</i> must refer to the
relationship of the Ruthvens and the King through the Angus
branch of the Douglases. <a name="citation250a"></a><a
href="#footnote250a" class="citation">[250a]</a></p>
<p>This question as to the meaning of Gowrie&rsquo;s emblem came
rather early into the controversy.&nbsp; William Sanderson, in
1656, published Lives of Mary and of James VI; he says: &lsquo;I
have a manuscript which relates that, in Padua, the Earl of
Gowrie, among other impressa (<i>sic</i>) in a fencing school,
caused to be painted, for his devise, a hand and sword aiming at
a crown.&rsquo; <a name="citation250b"></a><a
href="#footnote250b" class="citation">[250b]</a>&nbsp; Mr. Scott,
in 1818, replied that the device, with the Ruthven arms,
&lsquo;is engraven on a stone taken from Gowrie House in Perth,
and preserved in the house of Freeland&rsquo; (a Ruthven
house).&nbsp; &lsquo;There is also, I have been told, a seal with
the same <!-- page 251--><a name="page251"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 251</span>engraving upon it, which probably
had been used by the Earls of Gowrie and by their predecessors,
the Lords of Ruthven.&rsquo; <a name="citation251a"></a><a
href="#footnote251a" class="citation">[251a]</a>&nbsp; But we
know of no such seal among Gowrie or Ruthven seals, nor do we
know the date of the engraving on stone cited by Mr. Scott.&nbsp;
In his opinion the armed man and crown might be an addition
granted by James III to William, first Lord Ruthven, in
1487&ndash;88.&nbsp; Ruthven took the part of the unhappy King,
who was mysteriously slain near Bannockburn.&nbsp; Mr. Scott then
guesses that this addition of 1488 implied that the armed man
pointed his sword at the crown, and exclaimed <i>Tibi Soli</i>,
meaning &lsquo;For Thee, O James III alone, <i>not</i> for thy
rebellious son,&rsquo; James IV.&nbsp; It may be so, but we have
no evidence for the use of the emblem before 1597.&nbsp;
Moreover, in Gowrie&rsquo;s arms, in Workman&rsquo;s MS., the
sword is sheathed.&nbsp; Again, the emblem at Padua showed a
&lsquo;black-a-more,&rsquo; or negro, and Sir Robert Douglas
could not but have recognised that the device was only part of
the ancestral Ruthven arms, if that was the case.&nbsp; The
&lsquo;black-a-more&rsquo; was horrifying to Ottavio Baldi, as
implying a dark intention.</p>
<p>Here we leave the additional and certainly curious mystery of
Gowrie&rsquo;s claims, as &lsquo;shadowed&rsquo; in his chosen
emblem.&nbsp; I know not if it be germane to the matter to add
that after Bothwell, in 1593, had seized James, by the aid of our
Gowrie&rsquo;s mother and sister, he uttered a singular hint to
Toby Matthew, Dean of Durham.&nbsp; He intruded himself on the
horrified Dean, hot from his successful raid, described with much
humour the kidnapping of the untrussed monarch, and let it be
understood that he was under the protection of Elizabeth, <i>that
there was a secret candidate for James&rsquo;s crown</i>, and
that he expected to be himself Lieutenant of the realm of
Scotland.&nbsp; Bothwell was closely <i>li&eacute;</i> with Lady
Gowrie (Dorothea Stewart), and our Gowrie presently joined him in
a &lsquo;band&rsquo; to serve Elizabeth and subdue James. <a

class="footnote">[61b]</a>&nbsp; Mr. Barb&eacute;, as we saw,
thinks that Robertson perjured himself, when he swore to having
seen Henderson steal out of the dark staircase and step over
Ruthven&rsquo;s body.&nbsp; On the other hand, Mr. Bisset thought
that Robertson spoke truth on this occasion, but concealed the
truth in his examination later, because his evidence implied that
Henderson left the dark staircase, not when Ramsay attacked
Ruthven, but later, when Ruthven had already been slain.&nbsp;
Mr. Bisset&rsquo;s theory was that Henderson had never been in
the turret during the crisis, but had entered the dark staircase
from a door of the dining-hall on the first floor.&nbsp; Such a
door existed, according to Lord Hailes, but when he wrote (1757)
no traces of this arrangement were extant.&nbsp; If such a door
there was, Henderson may have slunk into the hall, out of the
dark staircase, and slipped forth again, at the moment when
Robertson, in his first deposition, swore to having seen
him.&nbsp; But Murray of Arbany cannot well have been there at
that moment, as he was with the party of Lennox and Mar,
battering at the door of the gallery chamber.&mdash;Bisset,

published at Perth, and with Longmans, a defence of the Ruthvens,
is very strong on the improbability that Henderson was at
Falkland.&nbsp; Why were not the people to whose house in
Falkland he went, called as witnesses?&nbsp; Indeed we do not
know.&nbsp; But as Mr. Panton looked on the King&rsquo;s
witnesses as a gang of murderous perjurers, it is odd that he did
not ask himself why they, and the King, did not perjure
themselves on this point.&nbsp; (<i>A Dissertation on the Gowry

willing to possesse me wyth his report of the death of Gowrie and
his brother, in the circumstances wherof sundrie thingis
occurring hardlie probable I was not curious to lett him see that
wyse men wyth vs stumbled therat.&nbsp; And therfor I thought yt

Fairest interpretation Yet because in deed truthe symplie canne
doe no wrong And that we owe or dearest and nearest truthes to or
soueraygnes in this matter so precisely masked lett me deliuer to
youe what For myne own part I doe belieue.</p>
<p>The King being readie to take horse was wythdrawen in
discourse with the Mr of Gowrie, a learned sweet and hurtles yong
gentleman, and one other attending.&nbsp; Now were it by occasion
of a picture (as is sayde) or otherwise, speech happening of
Earle Gowrie his father executed, the king angrelie sayde he was
a traitour, whereat the youth showing a greeved and
expostulatorie countenance and happelie Scot-like Woordis, the
King, seeing hymself alone and wythout weapon, cryed, Treason,
Treason.&nbsp; The Mr abashed much to see the king so apprehend
yt, whilest the king wold call to the Lords, the Duke, Marre, and
others that were attending in the court on the king comming to
horse, putt his hand with earnest deprecations to staie the king,
showing his countenance to them wythout in that moode,
immediatlie falling on his knees to entreat the King.&nbsp; At
the K. sound of Treason, from out of the Lower Chamber hastelie
running Harris the physician Ramsey his page and Sr Thomas Erskyn
came to where the king was Where Ramsey runne the poore gentleman
thorough, sitting as is saide vpon his knees.</p>
<p>At this stirr the earle wyth his Mr Stablere and somme other,

&amp;c. imputed to the dead earle, wyth the death of the Mr
Stabler, Wyth making knyghtis the actors, And manye others such

as I heare are asked to make a thankgyving to god, where they

to France in 1599&ndash;1600, to call Gowrie home.&nbsp; In a
brief account of his own life, dictated by himself at about the
age of seventy (1624), he says, &lsquo;I was in France for the
calling of the <i>Master</i>&rsquo; (he clearly means
<i>Earl</i>) &lsquo;of Gowrie&rsquo; (Wodrow&rsquo;s &lsquo;Life
of the Rev. Robert Bruce,&rsquo; p. 10, 1843).&nbsp; Calderwood
possessed, and Wodrow (<i>circ.</i> 1715) acquired, two
&lsquo;Meditations&rsquo; by Mr. Bruce of August 3, 4,
1600.&nbsp; Wodrow promises to print them, but does not, and when
his book was edited in 1843, they could not be found.&nbsp; He
says that &lsquo;Mr. Bruce appears to have been prepared, in
Providence,&rsquo; for his Gowrie troubles, judging (apparently)
by these &lsquo;Meditations.&rsquo;&nbsp; But Mr. Henry Paton has
searched for and found the lost &lsquo;Meditations&rsquo; in MS.,
which are mere spiritual outpourings.&nbsp; Wodrow&rsquo;s
meaning is therefore obscure.&nbsp; Mr. Bruce had great celebrity
as a prophet, but where Wodrow found prophecy in the
&lsquo;Meditations&rsquo; of August 3, 4, 1600, is not apparent
(Wodrow&rsquo;s &lsquo;Bruce,&rsquo; pp. 83, 84.&nbsp; Wodrow

Barb&eacute;, has the following &lsquo;observes&rsquo; upon this
point.&nbsp; It has been asserted by Calderwood that,
&lsquo;while the Earl was in Strathbraan, fifteen days before the
fact&rsquo; (say July 20), &lsquo;the King wrote sundry letters
to the Earl, desiring him to come and hunt with him in the wood
of Falkland, which letters were found in my lord&rsquo;s pocket,
as is reported, but were destroyed.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. Barb&eacute;
then proves that letters <i>were</i> sent to Gowrie and Atholl in
the last days of July.&nbsp; It is certain that a letter was sent
to Gowrie about July 20, possibly a sporting invitation, not that
there was any harm in an invitation to join a hunting
party.&nbsp; James is next accused of &lsquo;trying to stifle the
rumour&rsquo; about this &lsquo;letter,&rsquo; by a direct
denial.&nbsp; This means that Craigengelt, Gowrie&rsquo;s
caterer, was asked whether he knew of any man or boy who came to
Gowrie from Court, and said that he did not, a negative reply
supposed to have been elicited by the torture to which
Craigengelt was certainly subjected.&nbsp; We only know that at
the end of July letters were sent to Gowrie, to Inchaffray, to
Atholl, and to Ruthven.&nbsp; Whether his reached Gowrie or not,
and what it contained, we cannot know.</p>

forger (which is untrue), but confessed to the Gowrie conspiracy
in return for boons to his wife and children.</p>
<p>We have, of course, no evidence that anything was done by
Government, or by any one, for Mrs. Sprot and the children.&nbsp;
The author of the MS., which Calderwood used as he pleased, avers
that Sprot denied on the scaffold the fact that he had any
promise.&nbsp; Neither draft nor official account confirms the
MS. history on the point of no promise.&nbsp; The official
<i>draft</i> of his last moments (from its interlineations, each
signed by the Clerk of Council) appears to have been drawn up on
the spot, or hurriedly, as soon as Sprot was dead.&nbsp; This is
the aspect of the <i>draft</i> of the account; the official
<i>printed</i> account says that there was &lsquo;no place of
writing on the scaffold, in respect of the press and multitude of
people&rsquo; (Pitcairn, ii. 261).</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://www.gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
